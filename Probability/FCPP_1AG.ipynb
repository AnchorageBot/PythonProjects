        "This problem is fundamentally a conditional probability problem. We're looking for the combination of red and total socks that results in a specific joint probability (drawing two red socks). Bayes' theorem is typically used for updating beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, we're not updating beliefs; we're directly calculating probabilities to find a specific condition. Therefore, direct calculation of conditional probability or solving the derived Diophantine equation are more efficient and appropriate methods. However, we can use the core relationship of joint and conditional probability, which is the numerator of Bayes' theorem.\n",
