If there are *R* red socks and *B* black socks, and *T = R + B* is the total number of socks, the probability of drawing two red socks is *R(R-1) / T(T-1)*, and the probability of drawing two black socks is *B(B-1) / T(T-1)*. The sum of these probabilities must be 1/2:\n",

You would then have to figure out under what conditions those expressions evaluate to integers, which is significantly more complex than directly solving the Diophantine equation.\n",

More complex Diophantine equations might require more sophisticated methods, but for this case, it works well.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why the Quadratic Formula is Less Suitable (in this particular case):**\n",
        "\n",
        "While the equation *is* quadratic in terms of *R*, applying the quadratic formula would give you *R* as a function of *T*, with square roots involved. You'd then have to determine which integer values of *T* result in integer values of *R*, making the problem more complex than necessary. The Diophantine form directly expresses the relationship between *R* and *T* in a way that allows for efficient integer search.\n",
        "\n",
        "**In summary:** The Diophantine approach is the natural and more efficient method for solving the sock drawer problem because it directly encodes the problem's constraints (integer numbers of socks and a specific probability) and is designed to find integer solutions.\n"
