Probability

Probability is a number between 0 and 1 (including both) that represents a degree of belief in a fact or prediction - Future events

*  [In common usage, the word "probability" is used to mean the chance that a particular event (or set of events) will occur expressed on a linear scale from 0 (impossibility) to 1 (certainty), also expressed as a percentage between 0 and 100%. - Wolfram Mathworld](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Probability.html)

Likelihood is the probability of the data under the hypothesis - Past events

* [Likelihood is the hypothetical probability that an event that has already occurred would yield a specific outcome. The concept differs from that of a probability in that a probability refers to the occurrence of future events, while a likelihood refers to past events with known outcomes. - Wolfram Mathworld](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Likelihood.html)

* Complementary events: The complement of event A is everything not in A. Complementary events are mutually
exclusive events and together make up the sample space. The probability of the sample space is one.
* Independent events: The occurrence of any one of the events does not affect the probabilities of the occurrences
of the other events. Events A and B are independent if probability of A given B equals probability of A.
* Dependent events (or non-independent events): Events that are not independent, i.e., P(A given B) ≠ P(A).
* Mutually exclusive events (or disjoint events): If event A occurs, then event B cannot occur, and conversely.
* De Morgan’s Rule (one form): Via a double complement, A or B = (Ac and Bc)c = “not [ (not A) and (not B) ]”. For
example, “I want A, B, or both to work” (Reliability) equates to “I do not want both A and B not to work” (Safety).
