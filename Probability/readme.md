Probability

Probability is a number between 0 and 1 (including both) that represents a degree of belief in a fact or prediction - Future events

*  [In common usage, the word "probability" is used to mean the chance that a particular event (or set of events) will occur expressed on a linear scale from 0 (impossibility) to 1 (certainty), also expressed as a percentage between 0 and 100%. - Wolfram Mathworld](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Probability.html)

Likelihood is the probability of the data under the hypothesis - Past events

* [Likelihood is the hypothetical probability that an event that has already occurred would yield a specific outcome. The concept differs from that of a probability in that a probability refers to the occurrence of future events, while a likelihood refers to past events with known outcomes. - Wolfram Mathworld](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Likelihood.html)
