        "\n",
        "## Evolutionary History\n",
        "Mosses are among Earth's oldest land plants, emerging around 470 million years ago during the Ordovician period. They belong to the bryophytes, a group of non-vascular plants that were among the first organisms to transition from aquatic to terrestrial life. This transition was a crucial step in Earth's history, as these early land plants began transforming the planet's atmosphere and creating conditions suitable for other life forms.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Basic Biology & Structure\n",
        "Mosses are unique in several ways:\n",
        "- Non-vascular plants (lacking true roots, stems, and leaves)\n",
        "- Use rhizoids instead of roots for anchoring\n",
        "- Absorb water and nutrients directly through their leaves\n",
        "- Reproduce through spores rather than seeds\n",
        "- Exhibit \"alternation of generations\" with distinct gametophyte and sporophyte phases\n",
