Day 2

* [Day 2 Livestream with Paige Bailey – 5-Day Gen AI Intensive Course | Kaggle](https://www.youtube.com/live/86GZC56rQCc?si=DbYJe8mzo4YwS_r4)

* Today you will learn about the conceptual underpinning of embeddings and vector databases and how they can be used to bring live or specialist data into your LLM application. You’ll also explore their geometrical powers for classifying and comparing textual data.

  * Understanding Embeddings: Why they are essential for handling multimodal data and their diverse applications.
     * In essence, embeddings are numerical representations of real-world data such as text,
       speech, image, or videos. They are expressed as low-dimensional vectors where the
       geometric distances of two vectors in the vector space is a projection of the relationships
       between the two real-world objects that the vectors represent. 
  * Embedding Techniques: Methods for mapping different data types into a common vector space.
  * Efficient Management: Techniques for storing, retrieving, and searching vast collections of embeddings.
  * Vector Databases: Specialized systems for managing and querying embeddings, including practical considerations for production deployment.
  * Real-World Applications: Concrete examples of how embeddings and vector databases are combined with large language models (LLMs) to       solve real-world problems.
