* [Operationalizing Generative AI on Vertex AI using MLOps](https://www.kaggle.com/whitepaper-operationalizing-generative-ai-on-vertex-ai-using-mlops)
  * [Whitepaper Companion Podcast - Operationalizing Generative AI on Vertex AI using MLOps](https://youtu.be/k9S6IhiUUj4?si=Y08hRKJT3WQHRJXp)
  * This whitepaper delves into the fundamental tenets of MLOps and the necessary adaptations required for the domain of gen AI and Foundation Models. We also examine the diverse range of Vertex AI products, specifically tailored to address the unique demands of foundation models and gen AI-based applications. Through this exploration we uncover how Vertex AI, with its solid foundations of AI infrastructure and MLOps tools, expands its capabilities to provide a comprehensive MLOps platform for gen AI.
  * For most Gen AI applications, instead of training models from scratch, we’re
taking foundation models (FMs) and then adapting them to our specific use case.
