* [Day 4 Livestream with Paige Bailey – 5-Day Gen AI Intensive Course | Kaggle](https://www.youtube.com/live/odvuLMJWUSU?si=a4ybCFKB7UDaVbSX)

* In today’s reading, you’ll delve into the creation and application of specialized LLMs like SecLM and MedLM/Med-PaLM, with insights from the researchers who built them.

* In the code labs you will learn how to add real world data to a model beyond its knowledge cut-off by grounding with Google Search.  You will also learn how to fine-tune a custom Gemini model using your own labeled data to solve custom tasks.
