        "*   **Understanding ‚Ñ§:**  The graph ‚Ñ§ is a one-dimensional line. Vertices are integers, and edges connect consecutive integers (i.e., edges are of the form {i, i+1}).\n",

        "*   **Proof:**\n",
        "    1.  **If p < 1:**  Let's consider the probability that there is a path of *k* consecutive open edges starting at the origin and going to the right.  Since edges are open independently with probability *p*, the probability of this specific path being open is p·µè.  Now, let's consider the event A‚Çô that there exists at least one edge between n and n+1 that is closed.  The probability of this event is 1-p. As n tends to infinity, the probability of every edge from n to n+1 is open, and the origin being connected to infinity will tend to 0. The probability no infinite cluster is equal to 1. So, for p<1, Œ∏(p)=0.\n",
        "\n",
        "    2.  **If p = 1:** All edges are open with probability 1.  Therefore, there is trivially an infinite cluster (the entire line), and Œ∏(1) = 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "    3.  **Conclusion:** Since Œ∏(p) = 0 for p < 1 and Œ∏(1) = 1, and p_c is defined as the infimum of p such that Œ∏(p) > 0, we have p_c(‚Ñ§) = 1.\n",

        "*   **Understanding ‚Ñ§ √ó {0, ..., n}:**  This graph can be visualized as *n+1* copies of the integer line ‚Ñ§, stacked vertically, with edges connecting corresponding vertices in adjacent \"layers.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Infinite Cluster Condition:**  An infinite cluster requires an infinite connected path of open edges.  Because the \"width\" in the vertical direction is finite (n+1), any infinite path must eventually extend infinitely far to the left or right (or both) within one or more of the \"layers.\"\n",

        "     1.  **Assume p < 1.**  Let's suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that p_c(‚Ñ§ √ó {0, ..., n}) < 1. This would mean there exists a *p* < 1 for which Œ∏(p) > 0, i.e., there's a positive probability of an infinite cluster.\n",

        "     3. **Finite Number of Layers**: Because there are only a *finite* number (n+1) of layers, and on any single copy, the origin is almost surely *not* in an infinte cluster, and therefore the entire graph (the union of all copies) has probability zero of having origin be connected to infinity for p<1.\n",
