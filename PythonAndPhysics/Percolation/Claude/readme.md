Glossary Table

| Symbol/Term | Definition/Meaning |
|------------|-------------------|
| G = (V,E) | A graph defined by vertex set V and edge set E |
| V | Set of vertices in a graph |
| E | Set of edges (unordered pairs of vertices) in a graph |
| e or xy | An edge with endpoints x and y |
| ℤᵈ | d-dimensional integer lattice (both vertex set and lattice structure) |
| ∥x - y∥ | Distance between vertices x and y |
| Λₙ | The set [-n,n]ᵈ for integer n ≥ 1 |
| ∂G | Boundary of graph G |
| ω | Percolation configuration (mapping edges to {0,1}) |
| p | Probability parameter for edge being open |
| θ(p) | Probability that origin is in an infinite cluster |
| pₖ | Critical probability = inf{p ∈ [0,1] : θ(p) > 0} |
| Ωₙ | Set of self-avoiding paths of length n from origin |
| (ℤ²)* | Dual graph of ℤ² |
| ω* | Dual configuration of ω |
| A ↔ B | Event that there exists a path connecting sets A and B |
| x ↔ ∞ | Event that vertex x is in an infinite connected component |
| ℙₚ | Product measure with parameter p |
| F | Increasing function on configuration space |
| 𝔽 | σ-algebra generated by finitely many edges |
| ℙ | Measure on [0,1] ↦ {0,1}^E with marginals ℙₚ |

**Key Concepts:**
1. Hypercubic Lattice: d-dimensional grid of points with integer coordinates
2. Square Lattice: Special case of hypercubic lattice when d=2
3. Bernoulli Percolation: Random process where edges are independently open with probability p
4. Self-avoiding Path: Path where no vertex is visited more than once
5. Infinite Cluster: Connected component containing infinitely many vertices
6. Critical Point: Threshold probability where infinite clusters first appear
7. Dual Graph: Graph constructed by placing vertices in faces of original graph
8. Increasing Event: Event more likely to occur as more edges become open
