Cylinder sets became a fundamental tool for constructing probability measures in these spaces by extending measures defined on finite-dimensional subspaces. Cylinder sets are particularly useful in infinite-dimensional spaces because they allow us to define events and probabilities based on the values of a *finite* number of coordinates, even when the underlying space has infinitely many dimensions.\n",
