 LaTeX Formatting for Google Colab

Block-Level Display (for centered equations)

$$
\mathbb{P}_p(B_n) \text{ is measurable in terms of } \omega_e \text{ for finitely many edges}
$$

$$
\mathcal{P}_p[B_n] \to \mathcal{P}_p[A] \text{ as } n \to \infty.
$$

Inline Display (if you need inline formatting)

\(\mathbb{P}_p(B_n) \text{ is measurable in terms of } \omega_e \text{ for finitely many edges}\)

\(\mathcal{P}_p[B_n] \to \mathcal{P}_p[A] \text{ as } n \to \infty.\)

Block-Level Display (Centered Equation)

$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} \mathcal{P}_p[B_n] = \mathcal{P}_p[A]
$$

Inline Display (Within Text)

\(\lim_{n \to \infty} \mathcal{P}_p[B_n] = \mathcal{P}_p[A]\)


How to Use in Google Colab
* If you want the equations centered on a new line, use the block format with $$.
* If you want the equations inline with text, use \(...\).
