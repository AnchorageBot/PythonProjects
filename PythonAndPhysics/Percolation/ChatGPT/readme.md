|----------------|------------|
| **𝐺 = (𝑉, 𝐸)** | A graph consisting of a set of vertices 𝑉 and edges 𝐸 |
| **𝑉**          | The set of vertices (nodes) in the graph |
| **𝐸**          | The set of edges (connections) between vertices |
| **𝑥, 𝑦**       | Elements (vertices) in the set 𝑉 |
| **𝑥𝑦**         | An edge connecting vertices 𝑥 and 𝑦 |
| **ℤᵈ**         | The d-dimensional integer lattice (set of all points with integer coordinates in d-dimensional space) |
| **ℝᵈ**         | The d-dimensional real space |
| **‖𝑥 − 𝑦‖ = 1** | The Euclidean norm condition defining edges: 𝑥 and 𝑦 are adjacent if their distance is exactly 1 |
| **Λₙ = [-𝑛, 𝑛]ᵈ** | A finite subset of the integer lattice, forming a hypercube of side length 2𝑛 in d-dimensions |
| **∂𝐺**         | The boundary of the graph 𝐺 |
| **∃𝑦 ∈ ℤᵈ**   | There exists a vertex 𝑦 in the integer lattice ℤᵈ |
| **𝑥 ∈ 𝑉**      | 𝑥 is a vertex in the set 𝑉 |
| **𝑥𝑦 ∈ 𝐸 \ 𝐸** | The edge 𝑥𝑦 belongs to the set of edges but not within 𝐸 (indicating an external connection) |
| **d-dimensional** | The number of dimensions in the hypercubic lattice |
| **hypercubic** | A lattice where each vertex is connected to its neighbors along each dimension by unit distance |
| **square lattice** | A 2-dimensional case of the hypercubic lattice (𝑑 = 2) |
