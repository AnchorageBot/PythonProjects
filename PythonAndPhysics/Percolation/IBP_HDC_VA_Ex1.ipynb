        "   - The probability measure **𝒫ₚ** is defined on the **𝜎-algebra 𝓕**, which is generated by events that depend only on a finite subset of edges.  \n",
        "   - This means that **any event in 𝓕 should be expressible as a limit of events depending on finitely many edges**.  \n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Construction of a Sequence of Approximating Events**  \n",
        "   - We need to construct a sequence **(𝐵ₙ)** where each **𝐵ₙ** depends on a finite number of edges and **converges to 𝐴 in probability**.  \n",
        "   - Define **𝐵ₙ** as the event that depends only on the states of edges within a finite box **Λₙ** of radius **n** around the origin.  \n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Limit Argument Using Increasing Events**  \n",
        "   - Since percolation configurations **𝜔** are defined on an **infinite** graph, we approximate them by considering restrictions to finite subgraphs **Λₙ**.  \n",
        "   - For large enough **n**, the probability measure of **𝐵ₙ** should be close to that of **𝐴**, ensuring:\n",
        "     \\[\n",
        "     \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} 𝒫ₚ[𝐵ₙ] = 𝒫ₚ[𝐴].\n",
        "     \\]\n",
        "   - This follows from the **definition of the product measure 𝒫ₚ** and the fact that **local events stabilize in probability as n increases**.  \n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Conclusion**  \n",
        "   - The construction ensures that **any measurable event 𝐴 can be well approximated by events depending on finitely many edges**.  \n",
