Since edges are open independently with probability *p*, the probability of this specific path being open is pᵏ.  Now, let's consider the event Aₙ that there exists at least one edge between n and n+1 that is closed.  The probability of this event is 1-p. As n tends to infinity, the probability of every edge from n to n+1 is open, and the origin being connected to infinity will tend to 0. The probability no infinite cluster is equal to 1. So, for p<1, θ(p)=0.\n",

        "*   **Infinite Cluster Condition:**  An infinite cluster requires an infinite connected path of open edges.  Because the \"width\" in the vertical direction is finite (n+1), any infinite path must eventually extend infinitely far to the left or right (or both) within one or more of the \"layers.\"\n",

        "     3. **Finite Number of Layers**: Because there are only a *finite* number (n+1) of layers, and on any single copy, the origin is almost surely *not* in an infinte cluster, and therefore the entire graph (the union of all copies) has probability zero of having origin be connected to infinity for p<1.\n",

        "\n",
        "We have shown that the critical probability for Bernoulli percolation on both ℤ and ℤ × {0, ..., n} is 1. This means that only when the probability of an edge being open is exactly 1 do we have a positive probability of an infinite cluster existing in these graphs.\n",
