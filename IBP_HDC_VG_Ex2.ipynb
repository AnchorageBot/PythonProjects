Since edges are open independently with probability *p*, the probability of this specific path being open is pᵏ.  Now, let's consider the event Aₙ that there exists at least one edge between n and n+1 that is closed.  The probability of this event is 1-p. As n tends to infinity, the probability of every edge from n to n+1 is open, and the origin being connected to infinity will tend to 0. The probability no infinite cluster is equal to 1. So, for p<1, θ(p)=0.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Concept:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Infimum (inf):** The greatest lower bound of a set.  If a set has a smallest element, that element is the infimum. If a set doesn't have a smallest element but *is* bounded below, the infimum is the largest number that is less than or equal to all elements of the set.\n",
        "*   **Supremum (sup):** The least upper bound of a set.  If a set has a largest element, that element is the supremum. If a set doesn't have a largest element but *is* bounded above, the supremum is the smallest number that is greater than or equal to all elements of the set.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why are infimum and supremum important?**  They generalize the concepts of minimum and maximum to sets that might not *have* a minimum or maximum element.  This is *crucially* important in analysis, where we often deal with infinite sets and sequences.  The minimum and maximum are only defined if the largest or smallest element is contained in the set. The infimum and supremum are always defined for bounded sets.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Historical Development:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Early Ideas (Ancient Greece):** The concept of a \"bound\" has roots in ancient Greek mathematics, particularly in geometry and the study of limits.  Think of Eudoxus and Archimedes' method of exhaustion, which implicitly used the idea of approaching a limit (and thus a bound).\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **19th Century Rigor (Bolzano, Weierstrass, Dedekind):** The formalization of the infimum and supremum is intimately tied to the rigorous development of real analysis in the 19th century.  Mathematicians like:\n",
        "    *   **Bernard Bolzano:**  In the early 19th century, he worked on ideas related to least upper bounds, although his work wasn't widely recognized at the time.\n",
        "    *   **Karl Weierstrass:**  In the mid-19th century, he is often credited with the modern, rigorous definition of limits, continuity, and the completeness of the real numbers, which implicitly uses the concept of least upper bounds (supremum) and greatest lower bounds (infimum).\n",
        "    *   **Richard Dedekind:** His \"Dedekind cuts\" (developed in the 1850s and published in 1872) provide a way to construct the real numbers and explicitly rely on the concept of least upper bounds.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Set Theory (Cantor):** Georg Cantor's work on set theory in the late 19th century provided a formal framework for dealing with infinite sets, and the concepts of infimum and supremum became essential tools.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **20th Century and Beyond:** The infimum and supremum have become fundamental concepts in:\n",
        "    *   **Real Analysis:**  They are used in definitions of continuity, limits, derivatives, integrals, and many other core concepts.\n",
        "    *   **Topology:** Generalizations of infimum and supremum appear in the study of topological spaces.\n",
        "    *   **Functional Analysis:** They are used in the study of function spaces.\n",
        "    *   **Optimization:** Finding the infimum or supremum of a function is often the goal in optimization problems.\n",
        "    *   **Probability and Measure Theory:** As we've seen in percolation theory, the critical probability is defined using the infimum.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's consider the set  `S = {1/n : n is a positive integer}`.  This set is:\n",
        "\n",
        "`S = {1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, ...}`\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Maximum and Supremum:** The largest element of `S` is 1.  Therefore, the maximum of `S` is 1, and the supremum of `S` is also 1 (sup S = 1).\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Minimum and Infimum:**  `S` does *not* have a smallest element.  As `n` gets larger and larger, `1/n` gets closer and closer to 0, but it never actually *reaches* 0.  However, 0 is a lower bound for `S` (every element of `S` is greater than 0).  Furthermore, 0 is the *greatest* lower bound.  Any number larger than 0 will fail to be a lower bound (you can always find an element of `S` smaller than it).  Therefore, the infimum of `S` is 0 (inf S = 0), but `S` has no minimum.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example in the context of percolation:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The critical probability, `p_c`, is defined as:\n",
        "\n",
        "`p_c := inf{p ∈ [0, 1] : θ(p) > 0}`\n",
        "\n",
        "*   `θ(p)` is the probability that the origin belongs to an infinite cluster.\n",
        "*   We're looking at the set of all probabilities `p` (between 0 and 1) for which `θ(p)` is greater than zero (i.e., for which there's a positive probability of an infinite cluster).\n",
        "*   We're taking the *infimum* of this set.  This is because there's a \"threshold\" behavior. Below a certain probability (`p_c`), there's almost surely no infinite cluster (`θ(p) = 0`). Above `p_c`, there's almost surely an infinite cluster (`θ(p) > 0`).  The infimum captures this critical transition point, even if there might not be a \"smallest\" `p` for which `θ(p) > 0`. The critical value, `p_c`, marks the transition.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, the infimum and supremum are essential tools for dealing with bounds of sets, particularly infinite sets, and they are fundamental to many areas of mathematics, including real analysis, probability theory, and, as we've seen, percolation theory. They provide a way to describe the \"smallest\" and \"largest\" values associated with a set, even when the set doesn't contain those values.\n"
