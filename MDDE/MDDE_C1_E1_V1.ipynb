        "1. First script:\n",
        "In this script, `force_ratio` is indeed explicitly defined in the `main()` function and then passed to `calculate_force_decrease_percentage()`.\n",

        "2. Second and third scripts:\n",
        "Although `force_ratio` isn't explicitly defined with that name, it's still being passed to the function. The variable name has changed, but the concept remains the same. Here's what's happening:\n",
        "\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   force_ratio_cruise = calculate_force_ratio(CRUISE_ALTITUDE)\n",
        "   force_decrease_cruise = calculate_force_decrease_percentage(force_ratio_cruise)\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   In these scripts, `force_ratio_cruise` is playing the role that `force_ratio` played in the first script. It's still a force ratio, just with a more specific name.\n",
        "\n",
        "The reason all three scripts use `def calculate_force_decrease_percentage(force_ratio):` is that this function is designed to work with any force ratio, not just the one at cruise altitude. The parameter name `force_ratio` in the function definition is a generic name that doesn't change, even if the variable names used when calling the function do change.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is an important concept in programming:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Function parameter names (like `force_ratio` in the function definition) are local to the function and don't need to match the names of the variables used when calling the function.\n",
        "- What matters is the value being passed, not the name of the variable holding that value.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, while the scripts evolved to use more specific variable names (`force_ratio_cruise`), the function itself remained general-purpose, able to calculate the force decrease percentage for any given force ratio.\n",
        "\n",
        "This approach allows the function to be more versatile and reusable. For example, if we wanted to calculate the force decrease at multiple altitudes, we could reuse this same function without modification.\n",
        "\n",
        "This question highlights an important aspect of function design and variable naming in programming."
