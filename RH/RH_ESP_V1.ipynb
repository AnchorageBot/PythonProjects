        "High-level summary of how Euler's Sine Product Formula and Riemann's Zeta Function Formula are related:\n",
        "\n",
        "In essence, these formulas exemplify how fundamental mathematical functions can be represented as infinite products, revealing deep structures and connections within mathematics. They both play crucial roles in complex analysis, number theory, and our understanding of the interplay between continuous and discrete mathematics.\n",
        "\n",
        "These two formulas, while seemingly different, are deeply connected in the realm of complex analysis and number theory:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Infinite Product Representation:\n",
        "   Both formulas use infinite products to represent fundamental mathematical functions. Euler's formula expresses the sine function as an infinite product, while Riemann's formula does the same for the zeta function.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Analytic Continuation:\n",
        "   Both formulas serve as examples of analytic continuation. Euler's formula extends the sine function to the complex plane, while Riemann's formula provides an analytic continuation of the zeta function beyond its initial domain.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Zeros of the Functions:\n",
        "   The zeros of the sine function (at nπ, where n is an integer) are clearly visible in Euler's formula. Similarly, Riemann's formula incorporates the non-trivial zeros of the zeta function (represented by α in the product).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Connection to Prime Numbers:\n",
        "   While not immediately apparent, both formulas have deep connections to prime numbers. The zeta function is intimately linked to the distribution of primes, and Euler's product formula for sine is related to Euler's product formula for the zeta function.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Functional Equations:\n",
        "   Both functions satisfy important functional equations. The sine function is odd (sin(-x) = -sin(x)), which is reflected in Euler's formula. The zeta function satisfies the Riemann functional equation, which is related to the form of Riemann's formula.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Historical Significance:\n",
        "   Both formulas represent significant achievements in mathematics. Euler's formula was a breakthrough in understanding trigonometric functions, while Riemann's formula was crucial in the study of the zeta function and its implications for prime number theory.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Complex Analysis Techniques:\n",
        "   The derivation and proof of both formulas involve sophisticated techniques from complex analysis, showcasing the power of this field in unifying seemingly disparate areas of mathematics.\n",
