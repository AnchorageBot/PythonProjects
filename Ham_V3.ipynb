        "A Hamiltonian is a mathematical operator or function used to represent the total energy of a system. It plays a crucial role in understanding the dynamics and properties of both classical and quantum systems.\n",

        "**Named After:**\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "In classical mechanics, the Hamiltonian is a function of the system's generalized coordinates and momenta. It represents the total energy of the system, which is the sum of its kinetic and potential energies. The Hamiltonian is used to formulate Hamilton's equations of motion, a set of differential equations that describe the time evolution of the system.\n",

        "**Quantum Mechanics:**\n",
        "\n",
        "In quantum mechanics, the Hamiltonian is an operator that acts on the wavefunction of a system. The eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian represent the possible energy levels of the system, and the corresponding eigenvectors are the energy eigenstates. The time evolution of a quantum system is governed by the Schrödinger equation, which involves the Hamiltonian.\n",
