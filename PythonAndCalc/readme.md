"Calculus began when Archimedes realized shapes could be split into parts and rearranged.​ After a lifetime of effort, he discovered connections between spheres, circles and other shapes that were later etched onto his tomb."

"Calculus is the art of splitting patterns apart (X-rays, derivatives) and gluing patterns together (Time-lapses, integrals). Numbers and equations describe what we have, but Calculus explains the steps that got us there."

Lagrange notation and Leibniz notation for derivatives of functions with a single independent variable f(x)

$f^{(n)}(x)$ = $\frac{d^ny}{dx^n}$ (nth derivative, general form)

$f'(x)$ = $\frac{dy}{dx}$ (first derivative)

$f''(x)$ = $\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}$ (second derivative)

Lagrange notation for partial derivatives of functions with two variables f(x,y)  

f<sup>′</sup> = $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$ = $f_x$ (first partial derivative with respect to x)

f<sub>'</sub> = $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}$ = $f_y$ (first partial derivative with respect to y)

f<sup>′′</sup> = $\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2}$ = $f_{xx}$ (second partial derivative with respect to x)

f<sup>′</sup><sub>'</sub> = $\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y\partial x}$ = $f_{xy}$ (mixed second partial derivative)

f<sub>''</sub> = $\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y^2}$ = $f_{yy}$ (second partial derivative with respect to y)

Equation formating:

* GitHub markdown: Uses single $ for inline and double $$ for display math, but not all GitHub views render it
* Google Colab: Fully supports LaTeX in markdown cells with $ and $$
* Jupyter notebooks: Same as Colab
* GitHub README files: Often people include an SVG or PNG of the equation since LaTeX isn't consistently rendered
