"Calculus began when Archimedes realized shapes could be split into parts and rearranged.â€‹ After a lifetime of effort, he discovered connections between spheres, circles and other shapes that were later etched onto his tomb."

"Calculus is the art of splitting patterns apart (X-rays, derivatives) and gluing patterns together (Time-lapses, integrals). Numbers and equations describe what we have, but Calculus explains the steps that got us there."
