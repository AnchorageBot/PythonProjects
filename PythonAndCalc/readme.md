"Calculus began when Archimedes realized shapes could be split into parts and rearranged.​ After a lifetime of effort, he discovered connections between spheres, circles and other shapes that were later etched onto his tomb."

"Calculus is the art of splitting patterns apart (X-rays, derivatives) and gluing patterns together (Time-lapses, integrals)."
