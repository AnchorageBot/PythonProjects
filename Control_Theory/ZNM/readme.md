The Ziegler-Nichols Method is a heuristic technique for tuning PID controllers, developed to give a good initial setting for the proportional (P), integral (I), and derivative (D) gains. There are two main approaches in the Ziegler-Nichols method: the Open-Loop (or Step Response) method and the Closed-Loop (or Ultimate Gain) method.
