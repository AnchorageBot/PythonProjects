A PID controller (Proportional-Integral-Derivative controller) is a type of feedback control system commonly used in industrial control systems to regulate temperature, flow, pressure, speed, and other variables. It continuously calculates an error value, which is the difference between a desired setpoint (SP) and a measured process variable (PV), and attempts to minimize this error by adjusting the process control inputs.

The controller has three terms:

* Proportional (P) – Corrects the error in proportion to its magnitude.
* Integral (I) – Corrects accumulated past errors over time.
* Derivative (D) – Anticipates future errors based on the rate of change.

Each term contributes to the overall control output, and the balance of these components determines how the system responds to changes in the process variable.
