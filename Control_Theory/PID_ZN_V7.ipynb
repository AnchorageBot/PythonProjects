        "Let's compare the two scripts based on their structure, PID tuning methods, and system dynamics.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **System Dynamics**:\n",
        "   - **The first-order system script** models a first-order system with the differential equation:  \n",
        "     `dy/dt = (-y + b * u) / a`  \n",
        "     which is simple and represents a thermal or similar system.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **The second-order system script** models a second-order system (mass-spring-damper) with the dynamics:  \n",
        "     `dx/dt = v,`  \n",
        "     `dv/dt = (u - b * v - k * x) / m`  \n",
        "     where `x` is position, `v` is velocity, `b` is the damping coefficient, and `k` is the spring constant.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Key difference**: The second-order system is inherently more prone to oscillations (due to the mass-spring relationship), while the first-order system requires specific gains to induce oscillatory behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **PID Controller Implementation**:\n",
        "   - Both scripts implement a PID controller in a similar manner. However:\n",
        "     - **The first-order system script** calculates PID output directly using proportional, integral, and derivative terms, which are updated in each iteration of the Euler integration loop.\n",
        "     - **The second-order system script** also has a PID controller but uses the `control` function, which is passed to the system's ODE and is called by `solve_ivp` as part of the integration.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Key difference**: The second-order system script uses the `solve_ivp` solver (Runge-Kutta method), which can offer better accuracy for simulating second-order systems, while the first-order system script uses Euler integration, which is more suitable for simple first-order systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **Simulation and Solver**:\n",
        "   - **The first-order system script** uses a manual loop with Euler integration to simulate the system.\n",
        "   - **The second-order system script** leverages `solve_ivp`, which is more sophisticated and handles complex ODEs better than Euler integration.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Key difference**: The second-order system script may handle dynamic systems with greater accuracy, especially for systems prone to oscillations.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **Peak Detection and Oscillation Detection**:\n",
        "   - **The first-order system script** uses `find_peaks` from SciPy to detect oscillations, but the sensitivity is set to detect very small peaks, which might not be ideal for all systems.\n",
        "   - **The second-order system script** also uses `find_peaks` but with modified detection parameters for a less sensitive, more robust detection process. It requires more peaks to determine oscillations and also checks that the oscillations are sustained (i.e., not decaying too quickly).\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Key difference**: The second-order system script includes more advanced logic for ensuring oscillations are sustained over time and checks the regularity of peak intervals and heights.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. **Ultimate Gain Tuning**:\n",
        "   - **The first-order system script** implements a Ziegler-Nichols tuning method by incrementing `Kp` until oscillations are detected. It assumes `Ku = 1`, which may not always hold true for all systems.\n",
        "   - **The second-order system script** also applies a Ziegler-Nichols method but increases `Kp` more aggressively (multiplies by 1.5 each time) and starts at higher values. Additionally, it adjusts the PID gains with slight modifications for more aggressive tuning.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Key difference**: The second-order system script has a more aggressive search for the ultimate gain and adjusts the Ziegler-Nichols tuning parameters to account for practical considerations (e.g., increased integral and derivative terms).\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. **Performance Metrics**:\n",
        "   - **The first-order system script** does not calculate performance metrics such as rise time, settling time, and overshoot.\n",
        "   - **The second-order system script** calculates these performance metrics and provides a detailed summary, helping assess how well the PID controller performs.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Key difference**: The second-order system script provides more insight into the performance of the PID controller by calculating key performance metrics.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 7. **Manual Fine-Tuning**:\n",
        "   - **The first-order system script** relies purely on the Ziegler-Nichols method.\n",
        "   - **The second-order system script** offers an option for manual fine-tuning of the PID parameters after the initial automatic tuning, allowing for human adjustments based on system behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Key difference**: The second-order system script offers a more flexible approach by allowing manual fine-tuning.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 8. **System Type**:\n",
        "   - **The first-order system script** works on a first-order system (typically simpler, fewer oscillations unless gains are very specific).\n",
        "   - **The second-order system script** works on a second-order system (mass-spring-damper), which inherently has the potential for oscillations due to its physical properties.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Summary of Differences:\n",
        "- **System Type**: First-order (first-order system script) vs. second-order (second-order system script).\n",
        "- **Solver**: Euler integration (first-order system script) vs. `solve_ivp` (second-order system script).\n",
        "- **Oscillation Detection**: Basic peak detection (first-order system script) vs. sustained oscillation detection (second-order system script).\n",
        "- **Ultimate Gain Tuning**: Basic search for `Kp` (first-order system script) vs. more aggressive search with modified Ziegler-Nichols parameters (second-order system script).\n",
        "- **Performance Metrics**: Not calculated (first-order system script) vs. detailed metrics (second-order system script).\n",
        "- **Manual Fine-Tuning**: Not available (first-order system script) vs. available in the second-order system script.\n",
