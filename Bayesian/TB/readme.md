* [Think Bayes: Bayesian Statistics in Python, 2nd Edition - Allen B. Downey](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/think-bayes-2nd/9781492089452/)

If you know how to program, you're ready to tackle Bayesian statistics. With this book, you'll learn how to solve statistical problems with Python code instead of mathematical formulas, using discrete probability distributions rather than continuous mathematics. Once you get the math out of the way, the Bayesian fundamentals will become clearer and you'll begin to apply these techniques to real-world problems.
