[Bayesian Probability - Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_probability)

Bayesian probability is an interpretation of the concept of probability, in which, instead of frequency or propensity of some 
phenomenon, probability is interpreted as reasonable expectation representing a state of knowledge or as quantification of a personal
belief.

The term Bayesian derives from the 18th-century mathematician and theologian Thomas Bayes, who provided the first mathematical
treatment of a non-trivial problem of statistical data analysis using what is now known as Bayesian inference. Mathematician 
Pierre-Simon Laplace pioneered and popularized what is now called Bayesian probability.
