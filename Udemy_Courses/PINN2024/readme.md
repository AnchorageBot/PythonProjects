* [Discretization - wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discretization)
   * In applied mathematics, discretization is the process of transferring continuous    functions, models, variables, and equations into discrete counterparts. 

* [Finite difference - wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference)
  * A finite difference is a mathematical expression of the form f (x + b) − f (x + a). If a finite difference is divided by b − a, one gets a difference quotient. The approximation of derivatives by finite differences plays a central role in finite difference methods for the numerical solution of differential equations, especially boundary value problems.
