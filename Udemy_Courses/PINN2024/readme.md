Additional background:

* [Boundary value problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_value_problem)
  * In the study of differential equations, a boundary-value problem is a differential equation subjected to constraints called boundary conditions.[1] A solution to a boundary value problem is a solution to the differential equation which also satisfies the boundary conditions.
 
* [Discretization - wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discretization)
   * In applied mathematics, discretization is the process of transferring continuous    functions, models, variables, and equations into discrete counterparts. 

* [Finite difference - wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference)
  * A finite difference is a mathematical expression of the form f (x + b) − f (x + a). If a finite difference is divided by b − a, one gets a difference quotient. The approximation of derivatives by finite differences plays a central role in finite difference methods for the numerical solution of differential equations, especially boundary value problems.
  * Three basic types are commonly considered: forward, backward, and central finite differences.
  * Finite differences were introduced by Brook Taylor in 1715 and have also been studied as abstract self-standing mathematical objects in works by George Boole (1860), L. M. Milne-Thomson (1933), and Károly Jordan (1939). Finite differences trace their origins back to one of Jost Bürgi's algorithms (c. 1592) and work by others including Isaac Newton. The formal calculus of finite differences can be viewed as an alternative to the calculus of infinitesimals.
