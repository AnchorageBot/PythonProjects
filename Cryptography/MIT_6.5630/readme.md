This course is about the evolution of proofs in computer science.  We will learn about the power of interactive proofs, multi-prover interactive proofs, and probabilistically checkable proofs.  We will then show how to use cryptography to convert these powerful proof systems into computationally sound non-interactive arguments (SNARGs).
