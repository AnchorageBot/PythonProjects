        "2. **Logical Operations (∀, +, -, ×, ÷, ∃)**: These represent the mathematical operations and logical transformations that can be applied to the axioms. In ZKPs, these operations are used to construct the proof itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **True/False Outcomes**: The endpoint of any logical proof system is to determine whether a statement is true or false. In ZKPs, the prover is trying to convince the verifier that a certain statement is true without revealing why it's true.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, in a typical ZKP:\n",
        "- The prover claims to know a solution to a problem (like a password or the solution to a complex equation)\n",
        "- Through a series of challenges and responses using logical and mathematical operations\n",
        "- The verifier becomes convinced the prover knows the solution (True)\n",
        "- Without learning anything about the solution itself\n",
        "\n",
        "This is particularly relevant in modern ZKP implementations like zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge) and zk-STARKs (Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent Arguments of Knowledge), which use sophisticated mathematical frameworks based on these logical principles.\n",
        "\n",
        "The diagram depicts the relationship between axioms and logical outcomes. The diagram and glossary would be helpful as a fundamental reference point for understanding how ZKPs transform mathematical statements into verifiable proofs without revealing the underlying secrets."

        "\n",
        "Sudoku is a popular logic-based number placement puzzle that originated in Japan. The classic version consists of a grid of 81 squares (9×9), divided into nine 3×3 blocks or \"boxes.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "### Basic Rules:\n",
        "1. The object of the game is to correctly fill in all the empty spaces with the correct numbers\n",
        "2. Each of the nine blocks must contain all the numbers 1-9 without any duplicates or omissions\n",
        "3. Each vertical nine-square column must contain all numbers 1-9 without duplicates or omissions\n",
        "4. Each horizontal nine-square row must contain all numbers 1-9 without duplicates or omissions\n",
        "5. You may only put one number in each square (unless they are notes, which are written smaller)\n",
        "\n",
        "### Starting Position:\n",
        "- A puzzle begins partially filled with some numbers (called \"givens\")\n",
        "- Every Sudoku has exactly one correct solution\n",
        "- The difficulty depends on the quantity and placement of the givens\n",
        "\n",
        "### Solving Process:\n",
        "The puzzle is solved through logical reasoning and deduction, not guesswork. Common techniques include:\n",
        "- **Scanning**: Looking for rows, columns, or blocks where a specific number can only fit in one position\n",
        "- **Marking up**: Noting possible candidates for each empty cell as small \"notes\"\n",
        "- **Cross-hatching**: Checking across rows and columns to eliminate possibilities\n",
        "- **Advanced techniques**: More complex logical patterns like X-Wing, Swordfish, and forcing chains\n",
        "\n",
        "### Mathematical Properties:\n",
        "- The minimum number of givens required for a unique solution is 17\n",
        "- The total number of valid 9×9 Sudoku grids is approximately 6.67 × 10²¹\n",
        "- Sudoku solving is classified as an NP-complete problem in computational complexity theory\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal is to figure out every empty square in the grid so that all rows, columns, and blocks follow the rules without conflicting with each other. When you have filled in all squares with the correct numbers, you win the game.\n",
        "\n",
        "Sudoku puzzles are excellent exercises for developing logical thinking skills and have become popular worldwide for their simple rules but challenging solutions."
