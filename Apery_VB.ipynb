        "### **Key Elements of Apéry's Proof:**\n",
        "1. **Construction of Special Sequences:**\n",
        "   - Apéry introduced two sequences of rational numbers, \\(a_n\\) and \\(b_n\\), defined using recurrence relations. These sequences were specifically constructed so that:\n",
        "     \\[\n",
        "     \\lim_{n → ∞} \\frac{a_n}{b_n} = ζ(3).\n",
        "     \\]\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Integer Approximations:**\n",
        "   - The terms of these sequences satisfy the property that \\(a_n\\) is an integer, while \\(b_n\\) is approximately proportional to \\(n³\\) (growing polynomially).\n",
        "   - This setup was crucial because it ensured that the sequence provided a very good rational approximation to ζ(3).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Linear Independence Argument:**\n",
        "   - Using properties of these sequences and advanced techniques in Diophantine approximation, Apéry demonstrated that ζ(3) could not satisfy any linear relation with rational coefficients. This implies ζ(3) is irrational.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Non-trivial Bounds:**\n",
        "   - The crux of the proof involved deriving sharp bounds on how well ζ(3) can be approximated by rational numbers, showing that no such rational approximation exists.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Significance:**\n",
        "- Apéry's proof was surprising and elegant, combining methods from analysis, number theory, and linear algebra.\n",
        "- The proof inspired further research into the irrationality and transcendence of values of the Riemann zeta function at other points.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Open Questions:**\n",
        "- While ζ(2) = π²/6 is known to be irrational (and transcendental), the irrationality of ζ(s) for odd integers \\(s > 3\\) remains an open problem.\n",

        "The issue with some formulas and symbols not rendering properly in the screenshot is likely due to differences in how **Markdown** and **LaTeX** are processed within the Google Colab environment. Here's why this happens:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Markdown Formatting with LaTeX**:\n",
        "   - In Google Colab, LaTeX equations need to be enclosed in specific delimiters for proper rendering:\n",
        "     - Use `\\( ... \\)` for inline LaTeX.\n",
        "     - Use `$$ ... $$` or `\\[ ... \\]` for block LaTeX.\n",
        "   - If these delimiters are not used correctly or are missing, the LaTeX code is treated as plain text and does not render.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Escaped Characters**:\n",
        "   - Characters like `\\` in LaTeX commands (e.g., `\\zeta` or `\\frac`) may be misinterpreted if the text is not properly marked as LaTeX.\n",
        "   - This can happen if the formula is written inside plain Markdown without the appropriate delimiters.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Environment-Specific Behavior**:\n",
        "   - Google Colab requires that Markdown cells explicitly process LaTeX to render mathematical formulas. If a Markdown cell contains plain text with LaTeX-style commands (e.g., `\\zeta`), it will simply display the text instead of rendering the formula.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Proper Use of Code vs. Text**:\n",
        "   - In your screenshot, some formulas may be within a `code block` (indicated by backticks or indentation), which prevents them from being rendered as LaTeX.\n",
        "   - Only content written outside code blocks and properly marked with LaTeX delimiters will render.\n",

        "---\n",

        "### **Solution to Fix Rendering in Google Colab:**\n",
        "To ensure consistent rendering of formulas:\n",
        "1. **For Inline Math**: Use `\\( ... \\)`.  \n",
        "   Example:\n",
