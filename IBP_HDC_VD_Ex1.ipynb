        "    *   This is a standard result in measure theory related to the approximation of measurable sets in product spaces. It can be shown that for any A ‚àà ‚Ñ±, and Œµ>0, there exists a finite union of disjoint cylinder sets, say C, such that P‚Çö[A Œî C] < Œµ/2.\n",
        "    *   Each of these cylinder sets depends on a finite number of edges.  Since E‚Çô grows to encompass all edges as n increases, we can find an N such that for all n ‚â• N, the finite set of edges upon which C depends is contained in E‚Çô.\n",

        "\n",
        "We have shown that for any measurable event A in the Bernoulli percolation model, there exists a sequence of events {B‚Çô} such that B‚Çô depends only on the edges within a box of size n, and the probability of the symmetric difference between A and B‚Çô goes to zero as n goes to infinity. This demonstrates that measurable events can be approximated by events depending on finitely many edges."
