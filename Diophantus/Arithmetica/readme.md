Diophantus’s Arithmetica is a list of over 200 algebraic problems with solutions,
dating from about∼250AD. In it he introduced algebraic manipulations on
equations including a symbol for one unknown (probably following other authors
in Alexandria). Although most of his methods were known to his Babylonian
and Egyptian predecessors (including Heron of Alexandria), his symbols allowed
for clearer solutions and to consider more complicated problems.
