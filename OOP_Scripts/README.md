[Object-Oriented Python - Irv Kalb](https://nostarch.com/object-oriented-python)

The book begins by demonstrating key problems inherent in procedural programming, then guides you through the basics of creating classes and objects in Python. You’ll build on this groundwork by developing buttons, text fields, and other GUI elements that are standard in event-driven environments. You’ll also use many real-world code examples and two pygame-based packages to help turn theory into practice, enabling you to easily write interactive games and applications complete with GUI widgets, animations, multiple scenes, and reusable game logic. In the final chapter, you’ll bring it all together by building a fully functional video game that incorporates many of the OOP techniques and GUI elements covered in the book.
