- - - -
Description
* In this first lecture, Professor Strang introduces the linear algebra principles critical for understanding
the content of the course.  In particular, matrix-vector multiplication  and the column space of a matrix and the rank.

Summary
* Independent columns = basis for the column space
* Rank = number of independent columns
* A = CR leads to: Row rank equals column rank
