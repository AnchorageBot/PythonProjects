Lecture 2: Multiplying and Factoring Matrices
- - - -
Description
* Multiplying and factoring matrices are the topics of this lecture. Professor Strang reviews multiplying columns by rows:  sum of rank one matrices. He also introduces the five most important factorizations.

Summary
* Multiply columns by rows:  sum of rank one matrices
- - - -
Five great factorizations:

 * from elimination
 * from orthogonalization (Gram-Schmidt)
 * from eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix 
 * diagonalizes  by the eigenvector matrix 
 (orthogonal)(diagonal)(orthogonal) = Singular Value Decomposition
