        "This modified code will show you:\n",
        "1. The initial cost grid and value function\n",
        "2. For each cell being processed:\n",
        "   * Its position and current cost\n",
        "   * Which case it falls into (corner, edge, or general)\n",
        "   * The calculations being performed\n",
        "   * The updated value for that cell\n",
        "3. The final value function after all calculations\n",

        "## Algorithm Workflow\n",
        "The algorithm works as follows:\n",
        "1. It starts from the bottom-right corner (the goal) and moves towards the top-left corner (the start).\n",
        "2. For each cell, it calculates the minimum cost to reach the goal from that cell.\n",
        "3. The cost for a cell is the sum of its own cost plus the minimum cost to reach the goal from the next possible position(s).\n",
        "4. For the bottom-right corner, it's just the cost of that cell.\n",
        "5. For the bottom row, it can only move right, so it adds the cost of the cell to its right.\n",
        "6. For the rightmost column, it can only move down, so it adds the cost of the cell below.\n",
        "7. For all other cells, it chooses the minimum between moving right and moving down.\n",
        "\n",
        "This process builds up the optimal value function, which represents the minimum cost to reach the goal from any given cell in the grid.\n",
