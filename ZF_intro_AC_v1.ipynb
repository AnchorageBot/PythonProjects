        "The Zermelo-Fraenkel (ZF) axioms form the foundation of modern set theory, which in turn provides a foundation for most of mathematics. They were developed in the early 20th century by Ernst Zermelo and later refined by Abraham Fraenkel to address paradoxes in naive set theory (like Russell's paradox).\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Axiom of Extensionality (Identity)**: Two sets are equal if and only if they contain the same elements.\n",
        "2. **Axiom of Foundation**: Every non-empty set contains an element that is disjoint from the original set, preventing infinite descent.\n",
        "3. **Axiom of Specification**: Given a set, we can form a subset containing exactly the elements that satisfy a given property.\n",
        "4. **Axiom of Pairing**: For any two sets, there exists a set containing exactly those two sets as elements.\n",
        "5. **Axiom of Union**: For any set of sets, there exists a set containing all elements of all the sets.\n",
        "6. **Axiom of Power Set**: For any set, there exists a set containing all its subsets.\n",
        "7. **Axiom of Infinity**: There exists an infinite set.\n",
        "8. **Axiom Schema of Replacement**: If a function is defined on a set, then the range of that function is also a set.\n",
        "\n",
        "When the **Axiom of Choice** is added to ZF, the system is referred to as ZFC (Zermelo-Fraenkel with Choice).\n",
