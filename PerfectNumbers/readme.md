Perfect Numbers

- - - -

In number theory, a perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive proper divisors, that is, divisors excluding the number itself.

It is not known whether there are any odd perfect numbers, nor whether infinitely many perfect numbers exist.

Theorem: If 2<sup>p</sup> − 1 is prime, then (2<sup>(p−1)</sup>)(2<sup>p</sup> − 1) is perfect.
