CATL's Sodium-Ion Battery: Better than Lithium?

Asianometry - YouTube

Contemporary Amperex Technology or CATL recently unveiled their first generation sodium ion
0:06
batteries for commercial use. I have been hearing a lot about this technology and thought
0:10
that it would be worth talking about.
0:13
Scientists started off developing sodium ion batteries right alongside lithium ion batteries.
0:18
Over time, lithium rose to dominance and sodium fell by the wayside. But now things have changed,
0:24
and sodium ion batteries have started to see renewed interest.
0:28
In this video, we will briefly review sodium ion batteries, their state of development,
0:32
and what their commercialization means for the renewable energy market
0:49
at large.
 SodiumIon Battery
1:02
Sodium ion batteries share a similar structure with lithium-ion batteries. They have a cathode,
1:07
an anode, a porous separator between the two, and an electrolyte. When the battery is being
1:13
used, ions migrate back and forth between the cathode and anode.
1:18
The primary difference between the two battery types is that their components are made of
1:21
different compounds. That is actually part of the appeal. It is likely that commercial
1:26
sodium ion batteries can share the same engineering and production methods as lithium ion batteries.
1:33
The single biggest advantage that sodium ion batteries have over lithium ion batteries
1:37
has to do with the availability of certain raw materials, and linked to that - cost.
1:43
Almost all of the world's lithium comes from four countries: Australia, Chile, China, and
1:48
Argentina. And this element is not particularly easy nor environmentally friendly to extract.
1:53
Furthermore, there are other critical elements like cobalt which present particularly large
1:58
environmental and humanitarian concerns.
2:02
The global supply of sodium by contrast is essentially unlimited. There are over 1,000
2:06
times more sodium than lithium in the earth's crust. This translates to a raw ingredient
2:10
cost of $150 per ton as compared to lithium's $5,000 - a 30x decrease.
 Molten Salt Batteries
2:19
Researchers have been trying to commercialize sodium ion batteries side by side with lithium
2:23
ion batteries. Development kicked off in the early 20th century, when it was discovered
2:28
that molten salts were capable of conducting high amounts of sodium ions.
2:33
In 1968, scientists at the Ford Company developed a sodium-sulfur battery for use in electric
2:39
vehicles. It was essentially made of a tube of metallic sodium dipped into another tube
2:43
of liquid sulfur.
2:45
Ford felt that a 350 pound sodium-sulfur battery could provide 200-300 miles of range for a
2:52
1,350 pound car running at 40 miles an hour. The minimum charge time was said to be half
2:59
an hour.
3:00
The biggest challenge was that it only worked at very high temperatures: 570 to 660 degrees
3:06
Fahrenheit or 300 to 350 degrees Celsius. As you might expect, this caused safety and
3:13
longevity issues - especially in cars. For instance, at those temperatures, the aluminum-based
3:19
container tubes would react with the battery chemicals and rupture.
3:24
Ford never was able to commercialize the technology for a working electric vehicle. And it makes
3:29
a lot of sense why molten salt batteries as they are called have yet to see wide use in
3:34
mobile electronics. But they do have several real-world applications. The most common is
3:39
to provide power for guidance systems in missiles.
3:43
But they are also ideal for extreme environments. I just finished a video about using them on
3:48
the surface of Venus!
3:50
Ford eventually sold this technology to a Japanese company called NGK. Today, they are
3:55
sold as stationary battery solutions for peak energy use and grid stabilization.
 Lithiumion Batteries
4:01
The Oil Crises of the 1970s revitalized interest in this technology. In 1985, South African
4:07
researchers created a new version of the molten salt battery using nickel chloride and sodium
4:13
tetrachloroaluminate.
4:15
The ZEBRA battery as it was called held a lot of promise. But in 1989 Sony successfully
4:21
commercialized the lithium-ion battery and its advantages quickly won over the industry.
4:26
From then on, research largely focused there.
4:29
Today, lithium ion battery technologies largely dominate the industry. They are the first
4:34
choice for use in electric vehicles, stationary batteries, and mobile gadgets.
4:40
But in the 2000s, concerns began emerging with regards to the supply of raw materials.
4:45
Like as I mentioned earlier, natural sources of lithium are limited and that cannot be
4:49
the case if we want to be truly serious about a carbon-free economy.
4:52
Secondly, a less heralded reason has to do with intellectual property rights. So many
4:59
patents have been filed around lithium ion technologies that new companies have to be
5:03
extremely careful not to run afoul of the lawyers. Sodium ion battery technologies in
5:08
contrast offer far larger green fields.
5:12
Thus starting in the 2010s, people started taking a second look at sodium ion batteries
5:18
- which would again use sodium, but at room temperatures. The number of publications relating
5:23
to sodium ion batteries began to quickly rise - and in recent years have even surpassed
5:28
that of lithium ion batteries.
5:31
Batteries, especially prototypes, wildly differ from one another. But for the most part, scientists
5:37
have started to hone in on a few high-potential sodium ion battery chemistries.
5:43
Most studies have converged on making the anodes from a substance called "hard carbon".
5:49
It can also be colloquially described as charcoal.
5:53
The electrolyte makes sure that the sodium ions can travel from the anode to the cathode.
5:59
These have to be of low viscosity, high conductivity, and be electrochemically stable. Researchers
6:05
have generally chosen sodium salts dissolved in solvents of organic carbonate. Though there
6:10
is plenty of research advocating for other options too. I wonâ€™t cover them here.
6:16
The cathode is where much of the latest research has been focused on, same as with the lithium
6:21
ion battery. Makes sense since the cathode is the single most expensive component in
6:26
the whole thing - and is key to its overall viability. Many candidate materials have emerged
6:32
as potential contenders.
6:35
The most common and closely studied class of cathode material are sodium layered oxides.
6:41
These are pretty wild. They have a crystalline structure made up of sheets of metal oxides
6:47
with sodium ions sandwiched in between.
6:50
They are distinguished with a P2, O3, and P3 notation that refers to their geometries.
6:57
The reason why they show so much promise is because their crystalline structures have
7:01
a lot in common with that of lithium cobalt oxide, the first legit cathode material in
7:08
lithium-ion batteries.
7:10
There has been a whole lot of research in cathode materials for sodium ion batteries.
7:14
Other researched candidates include sulfides, phosphates, fluorophosphates, carbonophosphates,
7:20
vanadium-based polyanionic compounds, and so on. CATL, for their part, has opted to
7:26
make their cathodes out of something else.
7:30
There has a been a whole lot of experimentation in the past years. The science has moved fast,
7:35
and the first few sodium ion battery products have started to inch towards the market.
7:40
The first really, actually commercial-ready sodium-ion battery looks to be a 18650 cell
7:47
created by the French research agency CNRS CEA in 2015.
7:55
18650 is a standard format size and refers to the battery's dimensions. 18 millimeters
8:00
wide, 65 millimeters tall, and the 0 means that it is a cylindrical format. The reported
8:06
energy density is about 90 watt hours per kilogram.
8:10
Two years later in 2017, the agency spun off the research into a startup called Tiamat
8:15
Energy. The company's long term objective is to develop low-voltage systems for hybrid
8:20
vehicles, and help ensure French technological sovereignty.
8:24
In June 2020, researchers at Washington State University and Pacific Northwest National
8:30
Laboratory announced a more advanced sodium ion battery. Its creators speculate that the
8:35
battery might be able to achieve a practical specific energy of ~160 watt hours per kilogram.
8:43
This is comparable to current lithium iron phosphate batteries. That being said, we should
8:48
temper our expectations here. Sodium has lower ionization potential or ionization energy
8:54
than lithium. This means that sodium ion batteries will have lower energy densities and operating
8:59
voltages than their lithium counterparts. And it is not clear whether they can ever
9:03
catch up to top line lithium ion batteries in this regard.
9:08
There are also a number of other technology startups trying to commercialize sodium ion
9:13
batteries. Some examples include UK-based Faradion Limited, Sweden-based Altris AB,
9:20
China-based HiNa Battery, and US-based Natron Energy.
9:26
Now that we have very, very briefly gone over the current state of the research in sodium
9:31
ion batteries, we can review the CATL announcement and get some perspective here.
 CATLs Announcement
9:37
In their announcement, CATL gave a few details about how their sodium ion battery works.
9:42
The anode is made out of hard carbon, as is commonly the case.
9:46
They noted that their hard carbon anode features a "unique porous structure", which lengthens
9:50
its cycle lifetime and allows for more sodium ion movement.
9:55
For the cathode however, they are using something interesting. They mention that they are using
9:59
a substance called Prussian white.
10:02
Prussian white is an analogue of a pigment called Prussian Blue. First synthesized over
10:07
300 years ago, the dye makes a beautiful blue shade and has been noted for removing heavy
10:11
toxic metals from the body. It is very cheap, easily made and nontoxic.
10:18
But some time in the early 2010s, researchers also noticed its suitability for use in sodium
10:24
ion battery cathodes. They have good discharge rates, and can sustain their capacity over
10:29
many charge cycles. Some tests have shown 95% retention even after 10,000 cycles.
10:36
One big drawback of Prussian Blue cathodes - and there will always be drawbacks - is
10:41
that they lose a lot of their capacity in the presence of moisture.
10:46
Other companies have been exploring Prussian blue cathodes. Notable companies include the
10:50
aforementioned Altris AB and Natron Energy.
10:54
CATL said that their first generation sodium ion battery can achieve energy densities of
10:59
up to 160 watt hours per kilogram. This is comparable to the Washington State battery
11:04
unveiled last June which as I mentioned, is in turn competitive with current lithium iron
11:09
phosphate batteries. The second generation hopes to be over 200 watt hours per kilogram.
11:15
Furthermore, like as I mentioned, the engineering and manufacturing processes are similar between
11:20
sodium and lithium ion batteries. So CATL can really take advantage of this by tightly
11:26
integrating their sodium ion offering into their existing lithium ion infrastructure
11:31
and product ecosystem.
11:33
It is worth keeping in mind though that since the two preparatory processes will have so
11:37
much overlap, sodium ion battery costs will not be drastically lower than lithium ion
11:42
batteries. Most of the savings will come from cheaper raw material costs.
11:48
It is like how gasoline prices don't rise and fall in step with oil prices. One paper
11:54
estimates that the end users will see 10-30% price savings using sodium-ion, with all things
12:00
being equal.
12:01
They called out battery system integration capabilities where they can mix and match
12:06
sodium and lithium ion batteries into one single system. Lithium ion batteries, which
12:11
right now have higher energy densities, are automatically used by the system when sodium
12:16
ion falls short. So that is kind of interesting.
 Conclusion
12:21
We talk a lot about new and exciting battery chemistries. But the reality is that a lot
12:25
of these concepts do not see commercialization, and far fewer get widely adopted.
12:30
For instance, lead acid batteries have been around for 150 years. Their energy densities
12:36
are not comparable with lithium ion and their materials are quite toxic.
12:41
Yet because lead acid batteries are cheap and reliable they are still very widely used.
12:46
In 2020, global lead acid battery sales totaled nearly $50 billion. Inertia really means a
12:53
whole lot.
12:55
So not everything will be a lithium ion battery-level of success. And it looks like sodium ion batteries
13:00
will never be able to replace lithium in certain use cases like mobile phones and other electronic
13:06
gadgets.
13:08
But they have potential in short-range electric vehicles and especially in stationary power
13:13
systems. Places where space is less of a big deal, making their lower energy density not
13:18
so much of a confounding factor.
13:20
For instance, energy storage for solar and wind renewables. Those areas, which operate
13:26
at scale, can also really appreciate the cost savings.
13:29
There are already some small startups in the space. But CATL is no ordinary enterprise.
13:36
They are the biggest battery company in the world and it appears that they will pour a
13:39
lot of resources into this endeavor, leveraging their size, manufacturing skill, and R&D savvy
13:46
to make this work. Let us see if they will succeed and help sodium ion live up to its
13:52
full potential.
