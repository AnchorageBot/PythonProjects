How Did China's LFP Batteries Get So Cheap?

Per Bloomberg, in 2024 lithium-ion  battery pack prices fell 20% to  
0:08
$115 per kilowatt-hour. It is  the biggest price cut since 2017.
0:14
At these prices, it is cheaper to buy Chinese  even with tariffs of 25%, 35% and perhaps 120%.
0:24
Central to this trend are the price  and technology developments going  
0:28
on in a specific type of battery:  Lithium Ion Iron Phosphate or LFP.
0:35
LFP batteries were once seen as cheap  and low-end, suffering fundamental  
0:40
chemistry weaknesses. Leave it to China  to engineer their way around such limits.
0:46
In this video, one of the most revolutionary  cost curves in energy history. China and the LFP.

## The Three Chemistries
0:53
Lithium ion batteries have two  electrodes: the cathode and anode.
0:58
The anode is usually just graphite.  So the cathode is the battery's most  
1:03
expensive part - over 70% of its value  - and how we distinguish between them.
1:10
In the industry there are three major chemistries.  First there are the two ternary batteries. They  
1:15
are called that because their cathodes  mix three materials in varying ratios:  
1:20
Nickel manganese cobalt, or NMC,  and Nickel Cobalt Aluminum or NCA.
1:28
The ternary batteries boast higher energy  densities, meaning that they can store  
1:32
more energy in the same size and weight.  So you can make a lighter battery pack,  
1:37
letting EVs potentially go  further on a single charge.
1:41
This is great, but it comes at a  cost. Nickel and cobalt are rarer,  
1:45
more expensive materials, which is a big deal  since raw materials are 70% of a battery's cost.
1:53
And the ternary batteries' higher  energy densities raise thermal risks,  
1:57
potentially leading to something called  thermal runaway - meaning a fire.
2:02
The LFPs are the third major chemistry,  
2:05
using a dual-chemistry cathode made from  iron phosphate. There is no cobalt or nickel.
2:12
Since iron and phosphorous are far more common  materials, LFPs hold a substantial cost advantage.  
2:19
They can also better hold their initial energy  capacity after many charge and discharge cycles.
2:26
The problem is that LFPs suffer  lower energy densities - about 90  
2:30
to 160 watt-hours per kilogram. NCA on the  other hand ranges 230 to 260 watt-hours per  
2:37
kilogram. And NMC the highest at 250  to 320 watt-hours per kilogram. This  
2:45
gap does narrow at a practical level  but it’s nevertheless substantial.
2:51
So all things being equal, EVs powered by LFP  batteries will not have ranges as long. That  
2:57
sucks, but an upside is that the lower energy  density also lowers the risks of thermal runaway.
3:04
So to make a big generalization, batteries  have three angles: Performance, cost,  
3:09
and safety. LFPs have cost and safety, but  not performance. NMC and NCA have performance,  
3:16
but not cost and safety.  You can't have everything.
3:21
## Battle of the Batteries
3:21
In the early years of lithium ion, the first  batteries were Lithium Cobalt Oxide or LCOs, an  
3:27
older chemistry that used about 0.95 kilograms of  cobalt for each kilogram-hour of energy capacity.
3:35
As lithium ion got more popular though,  
3:37
it became clear that using this much cobalt  - which had to come from the Democratic  
3:41
Republic of Congo - was not economically,  morally, or environmentally sustainable.
3:48
This is how ternary battery chemistries like  NCA, NMC, and a third one I haven't mentioned  
3:54
before called Lithium Manganese Oxide or LMO  first gained traction. They still used cobalt,  
4:01
but far less of it. 0.14 kilograms in the  case of NCA, and 0.4 kilograms for NMC.
4:09
In the 2010s, pioneering EV cars in the West  like the Chevrolet Volt, the Nissan Leaf,  
4:14
and the Tesla Model S ran on battery packs  made with ternary cathode chemistries.
4:22
Meanwhile in China, China's first EV makers  adopted LFPs for their new energy vehicles,  
4:27
particularly buses, due to the influence  of early government industrial policies  
4:32
like the "Thousands of Vehicles,  Tens of Cities" policy or TVTC.
4:37
Launched in 2009, TVTC issued subsidies to  various municipal governments to have them  
4:43
purchase public service fleets like buses, taxis,  and government cars. The idea was to address  
4:50
urban air pollution, energy security  issues, and make Chinese EVs great.
4:56
Chinese companies like BYD adopted LFPs  early on due to cost and safety concerns,  
5:03
becoming strong pioneers in the  space. And for the first few years,  
5:07
LFP chemistries dominated the Chinese EV industry.
5:12
In late 2016, however, the Chinese  government started changing its subsidy  
5:15
policies in an attempt to push the EV industry  to produce cars more attractive to consumers.
5:22
The policy linked car subsidies to several  factors like higher energy density,  
5:27
longer driving ranges, faster charging rates,  
5:30
and fuel savings. If the EV had range of less  than 150 kilometers, then no soup for you.
5:38
This favored cars with  ternary battery chemistries,  
5:41
which could unlock the juiciest  subsidies, offer the lowest prices,  
5:45
and capture market share. And over the next  three years, even long-time LFP loyalists  
5:51
adopted ternary. Like BYD and their 2017 models  of the Tang 100, Song EV 300 and the Qin EV 300.
6:00
By mid 2019, ternary batteries reached  about 70% share of installed capacity.  
6:05
The market share of LFPs fell to 30%  and in some quarters, even lower.
6:12
## The Subsidies Withdraw
6:12
Two major developments reversed  this trend and revitalized the LFP.
6:17
The first started in June 2019, when  the Chinese government signaled that  
6:21
the EV cash subsidy policies instituted three  years earlier would be gradually withdrawn.
6:28
Now, people have known this was coming.  The scale of the subsidies had gotten  
6:32
to be somewhat significant. There were also  unsavory reports of "subsidy cheating" - with  
6:38
companies making up fake customers or  registering fake cars for free money.
6:43
The Chinese government probably felt it was time  to move on to non-monetary forms of support,  
6:49
like streamlining the issuing of  drivers' licenses to those with EVs.
6:54
However, the size and schedule of  the withdrawn subsidies somewhat  
6:58
surprised the Chinese EV industry. Right  off the bat in mid-2019, the subsidy was  
7:03
reduced by 50%. More chunks of the subsidy  would be removed in each subsequent year.
7:10
This aggressive sunsetting leveled the cost  playing field. EV makers rushed to switch back  
7:16
to LFP. At the same time, LFP makers rolled out  new technologies to curb fundamental weaknesses.
7:25
## Blade
7:25
Back in 2021, many years ago, I did a video  about CATL, the Chinese battery giant.
7:31
And in that video, I briefly mentioned the BYD  Blade battery, though didn't say much about it.  
7:36
I probably should have, since as it turns out,  the BYD Blade remade EV battery manufacturing.
7:43
BYD first introduced the Blade in March 2020, and  it debuted in the company's BYD flagship sedan,  
7:50
the Han, a few months later. So what  is the big deal about the Blade?
7:54
An EV battery has three manufacturing  levels: Packs, modules, and cells.
8:00
Cells are the battery's smallest and most  fundamental blocks. They have the cathode,  
8:05
anode, and electrolyte chemicals in various  shape factors like pouches or cylinders.
8:11
There might be thousands or even  tens of thousands of cells in a  
8:15
pack. Sliding so many cells into a pack  presents challenges. Handling so many  
8:21
at once is hard, and there are concerns with  maintaining the pack's structural integrity.
8:27
So what traditional EV battery manufacturers  did was to group battery cells into modules.  
8:33
The number of cells in a module  is arbitrary, ranging from four  
8:37
to twelve, but it offers an intermediate  building block towards the final pack.
8:43
What BYD did with the Blade was to entirely  skip the module, sliding cells directly into  
8:49
the battery pack. Ergo the name, Cell-to-Pack  or CTP. The idea is to compensate for LFP's  
8:57
fundamentally worse energy density by  making maximum use of the pack's volume.
9:03
To maintain the whole pack's structural  integrity, BYD uses a cell form factor  
9:07
called the prismatic cell. A prismatic cell  is a long and flat pouch of many stacked  
9:13
layers of materials inside a  rigid rectangular metal casing  
9:17
that offers structural integrity. To help  prevent swelling, there might be a clamp.
9:23
BYD re-engineered the prismatic cell form  factor into a very long, ultra-thin shape.  
9:28
The metal casing basically spans the width of  the whole battery pack. Ergo the name, Blade.
9:35
The Blade was a game-changer. The  Extended Range version of the 2020  
9:39
Han EV had range of 605 kilometers. Note  that this and other numbers cited here  
9:45
were calculated using a rather  forgiving range formula out of  
9:48
Europe called NEDC. So I can't say they  are comparable with US range metrics.
9:55
Anyway, 605 kilometers was in the same  neighborhood of the Model 3 with 668 kilometers,  
10:02
and the Xpeng P7 with 706 kilometers. But those  were premium EVs running ternary batteries,  
10:10
costing anywhere from 270,000 to 330,000 RMB.
10:16
The Han on the other hand got its  range numbers using just LFP batteries,  
10:20
and cost just 210,000 to 258,000 RMB.
10:26
CTP gives LFP battery packs about 85% the energy  density of a conventional NMC battery. And those  
10:34
ternary batteries have a tough time adopting CTP  for themselves due to their hotter temperatures.
10:41
Soon afterwards, other major Chinese  EV battery makers adopted the concept.  
10:46
CATL for instance, brought out their  very creatively named CTP technology,  
10:51
which they used for their Qilin battery pack.
10:55
LFP battery volumes overtook NMC in 2021. And  by 2023, they accounted for nearly 70% of EV  
11:03
installations, per the China Automotive  Battery Industry Innovation Alliance.
11:10
NMC batteries are still better in energy density,  but are now primarily used for the premium,  
11:16
high performance cars. For example, the  Xiaomi SU7's Max and Ultra versions.
11:23
## Patents
11:23
Another major helpful development  for China involved patents.
11:26
The current lithium ion battery structure - with  
11:29
its focus on cathodes - was discovered  and patented by the American scientist  
11:33
and Nobel winner Dr. John Goodenough.  He also pioneered the LFP cathode too.
11:40
However, the LFP as invented by Goodenough was  not commercially performant. In particular,  
11:45
there were poor electrical conductivity  issues. The charge carriers could not move  
11:50
between the cathode and anode fast  enough during charge and discharge.
11:55
Years later, key innovations in carbon coating  and process technologies were invented,  
11:59
making the LFP a commercially  competitive product. These were  
12:03
patented by researchers at universities  and public entities in Canada and Europe.  
12:08
All these patents were then consolidated into a  single Swiss entity managing global licensing.
12:15
According to the IEA, there was a deal  made in the 2000s or 2010s that allowed  
12:20
the Chinese battery-makers to use  these LFP battery patents for free,  
12:25
but only for their local markets. Everyone else  had to negotiate for and pay a license fee.
12:32
This strange sort of "patent shield"  allowed the Chinese to lean into and  
12:37
build up proficiency in LFP. Meanwhile, the  rest of the world's EV battery makers pursued  
12:42
non-LFP structures - hesitating  at the patent licensing issue.
12:48
These patents finally expired in 2022. On  one hand, this meant that foreign battery  
12:54
makers can finally access and use the LFP  chemistry themselves without worrying about  
12:59
these licensing fees. But anyone trying to  do that was starting out massively behind.
13:05
Because in the years leading up to 2022,  the Chinese battery makers had built up  
13:09
immense LFP supply chain proficiency.  They had the cell-to-pack innovations,  
13:14
massive economies of scale, materials  sourcing, talent pipelines, and more.
13:20
## Competition
13:20
Until 2021, BYD practiced vertical integration.  BYD batteries were only for BYD cars.
13:28
This was necessary in the early days when  the technology was immature. But it also  
13:32
allowed other third party makers like CATL  and LG Energy Solution a spot in the market.
13:39
In 2021 this changed and BYD started selling its  Blade batteries to third parties like Toyota,  
13:46
Ford, and other car companies. This introduced a  
13:49
major new Tier 1 battery supplier to  the market, triggering a price war.
13:54
This is on top of the already-insanely competitive  situation in the Chinese EV market. The Financial  
14:01
Times recently reported that a new Chinese  EV model hits the market every two days.
14:07
Car makers are looking for ways to  differentiate themselves particularly  
14:10
at the high end. More range, faster  charging, you know what I mean. So  
14:15
LFP makers are looking to new production  methods or recipes to fulfill those needs.
14:21
An interesting one is LMFP, Lithium  Manganese Iron Phosphate. Where you add  
14:27
manganese and get a battery with higher  energy density than your ordinary LFP.
14:32
Another is the "double firing" (二烧)  process flow. Traditional LFP makers  
14:37
take the raw precursors of their cathodes  - lithium salt, iron phosphate, carbon.
14:42
And then they "fire" those ingredients in a single  
14:45
high-temperature run to trigger certain  chemical reactions and sinter particles.
14:51
The issue with single-firing however is  that it can cause uneven grain growth  
14:56
and poor carbon coatings, leading  to inferior conductivity issues.
15:02
So the new idea from the Chinese is to dual-fire,  
15:06
you first partially fire up the  precursors at a lower temperature.
15:11
Then you mill and carbon coat  the resulting particles before  
15:14
doing a second firing. You get more  uniform and similarly sized particles,  
15:20
translating to better, more  consistent performance.
15:23
Perfect for long-range, fast-charging EVs.
15:27
## Raw Materials A significant factor in the lithium ion battery
15:30
price crash was a concurrent crash  in raw materials prices after 2022.
15:36
As I mentioned earlier, 70-80% of the cost of  a battery cell is the cost of its materials.
15:43
And in the case of LFP, 80% of that material  
15:46
cost is the cost of the iron  phosphate and lithium alone.
15:50
In 2023, new lithium sources came online  in Australia, Chile and Argentina.  
15:56
This rapidly reversed what had been a lithium  shortage in 2022, causing prices to crash.
16:03
The glut has caused a few mines to produce losses.
16:06
But their Chinese operators are injecting cash  
16:09
to keep them open and mining for  political and technical reasons.
16:15
And as for iron ore, iron prices reversed from its  2022 highs thanks to China's real estate crisis.  
16:23
That crisis has mothballed  China's crude steel production,  
16:26
which in turn caused iron ore  prices to fall 15% in 2024 alone.
16:33
All this means that Chinese EV battery  makers can cut battery prices - and they  
16:38
have to due to the intense competitive  environment - and still make profit.
16:43
In 2024, CATL revenues declined 9% from  400 billion RMB to 362 billion RMB,  
16:52
but gross profit margins rose 19.2% to 24.4%.
16:59
Now, I do admit that 24% isn't exactly  super exciting. It's nothing like Meta's  
17:04
81% margins or even Apple's 42.7% gross  margins. But at scale, those add up.
17:11
## Utility-Scale
17:11
The LFP battery's crashing prices has had  spillover effects in other industries beyond EVs.
17:18
I have recently been researching a few videos  relating to utility-scale stationary energy  
17:23
storage systems - ways to store power produced by  wind or solar during times of low energy demand.
17:30
You lose some amount of energy from  converting the power into something  
17:33
else and then getting it back again, but the  idea is that it is cheaper than trying to ramp  
17:38
up a coal plant or something else like  that during peak hours. It's arbitrage.
17:43
The canonical system is pumped storage, which I  covered in an earlier video. It is very simple,  
17:49
a reservoir up on a hill. When power is cheap,  
17:52
we pump water up into it. When we  need power, we drop water down.
17:56
But there are other methods  that are a bit stranger. For  
17:59
example. My personal favorite is  "power to gas". This is where we  
18:03
use a method called electrolysis to  split water molecules into hydrogen.
18:08
And then in a second step, we  capture carbon dioxide from the  
18:11
air and fuse it into the hydrogen  to produce methane. In other words,  
18:16
natural gas. The idea being that we can  plug in to existing LNG infrastructure.
18:24
This particular scheme and virtually  all others are now uncompetitive as the  
18:28
crashing costs of LFP batteries  have tipped the market to BESS,  
18:33
or Battery Energy Storage Systems.  LFPs were already favored for BESS  
18:37
prior to 2021 due to their cheaper material  costs and resistance to thermal runaway.
18:44
But the Chinese EV boom in 2021  has really set BESS on fire,  
18:48
figuratively. They are not competitive  in sheer capacity size (yet),  
18:53
they only provide 1-2 hours of power rather  than the 4-12 hours that pumped storage can.
18:59
But BESS are cheap - incredibly cheap  - and are simple to build. The whole  
19:04
system is put inside a standard-sized  container and brought over to the site.
19:10
And while there are legitimate  fire concerns with BESS,  
19:13
vendors are getting better at controlling them.
19:17
Billions of dollars are pouring into BESS projects  across the United States, particularly in the  
19:22
states of California and Texas. $11.45  billion in the first half of 2024 alone,  
19:29
with funds coming not only from government  but also banks and infrastructure hedge  
19:34
funds. How those projects will be affected  by tariffs, though, we have yet to see.
19:40
## Conclusion
19:40
The Chinese EV and stationary battery  industries continue to churn forward.  
19:44
Market analysts point out that  LFP prices will continue to fall,  
19:48
but probably nowhere near as  fast as they were in prior years.
19:52
I think one of the most interesting  industry developments to keep an eye on is  
19:57
the forthcoming technology progress of sodium ion.
20:00
I covered this in another video a few  years back and have not mentioned much  
20:04
about it since. But CATL, BYD  and Huawei are all pursuing it.
20:10
Sodium ion suffers fundamental energy  density shortcomings against lithium  
20:14
ion. But sodium is far more accessible than  lithium, seems to be able to charge faster,  
20:20
and energy density numbers are getting better.
20:23
Considering how optimized the LFP supply chain is,  
20:27
I wonder if sodium will be  as impactful. We shall see.
