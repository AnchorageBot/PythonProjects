# Battery Chemistry Comparison

| Acronym | Full Name | Energy Density (Wh/kg) | Typical Usage |
|---------|-----------|------------------------|---------------|
| LFP | Lithium Iron Phosphate | 90-160 (up to 205 in newest versions) | Mass market EVs, energy storage systems (BESS), public transport fleets; valued for lower cost and enhanced safety |
| NMC | Nickel Manganese Cobalt | 150-220 | Premium EVs requiring higher range and performance; highest energy density option |
| NCA | Nickel Cobalt Aluminum | 200-260 | High-performance EVs; offers good energy density balance |
| LCO | Lithium Cobalt Oxide | 150-180 | Mobile devices like smartphones, laptops, and cameras; high energy density but limited safety |
| LMO | Lithium Manganese Oxide | 100-150 | Power tools, medical equipment, early EVs like Chevrolet Volt, Nissan Leaf |
| LMFP | Lithium Manganese Iron Phosphate | 190-240 | Newer EVs requiring better energy density than standard LFP; emerging technology with improved performance |
| LTO | Lithium Titanate | 60-90 | Applications requiring fast charging, high power, long cycle life, and extreme temperature tolerance |
| SIB | Sodium-ion Battery | ~90-160 | Stationary energy storage, potential for short-range EVs; uses abundant sodium instead of lithium |
| NaS | Sodium-Sulfur Battery | 110-150 | High-temperature battery (300-350Â°C); used for grid stabilization, extreme environments, and space applications |
| ZEBRA | Sodium Nickel Chloride (Zero Emission Battery Research Activity) | 90-120 | High-temperature molten salt battery; safer alternative to NaS; suitable for EVs operating at extreme temperatures |
| Lead-acid | Lead-acid | 30-40 | Traditional batteries for automotive starting, lighting, ignition; backup power supplies; UPS systems |

**Note:** Energy density values are based on the transcript information and additional research. The actual values may vary based on specific battery designs and manufacturing processes. The NEDC (New European Driving Cycle) range standard mentioned in the first transcript is generally considered more optimistic than EPA standards used in the US. Sodium-ion batteries from CATL are reported to achieve 160 Wh/kg in first generation with goals of exceeding 200 Wh/kg in second generation.
