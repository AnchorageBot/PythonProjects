# Battery Chemistry Comparison

| Acronym | Full Name | Energy Density (Wh/kg) | Typical Usage |
|---------|-----------|------------------------|---------------|
| LFP | Lithium Iron Phosphate | 90-160 | Mass market EVs, energy storage systems (BESS), public transport fleets; valued for lower cost and enhanced safety |
| NMC | Nickel Manganese Cobalt | 250-320 | Premium EVs requiring higher range and performance; highest energy density option |
| NCA | Nickel Cobalt Aluminum | 230-260 | High-performance EVs; offers good energy density balance |
| LCO | Lithium Cobalt Oxide | Not specified (older chemistry) | Early lithium-ion batteries; used high amounts of cobalt (0.95kg per kWh) |
| LMO | Lithium Manganese Oxide | Not specified | Early EVs like Chevrolet Volt, Nissan Leaf |
| LMFP | Lithium Manganese Iron Phosphate | Higher than standard LFP | Newer EVs requiring better energy density than standard LFP |
| SIB | Sodium-ion Battery | ~90-160 | Stationary energy storage, potential for short-range EVs; uses abundant sodium instead of lithium |
| NaS | Sodium-Sulfur Battery | 110-150 | High-temperature battery (300-350Â°C); used for grid stabilization, extreme environments, and space applications |
| ZEBRA | Sodium Nickel Chloride (Zero Emission Battery Research Activity) | 90-120 | High-temperature molten salt battery; safer alternative to NaS; suitable for EVs operating at extreme temperatures |
| Lead-acid | Lead-acid | 30-40 | Traditional batteries for automotive starting, lighting, ignition; backup power supplies; UPS systems |

**Note:** Energy density values are based on the transcript information and additional research. The actual values may vary based on specific battery designs and manufacturing processes. The NEDC (New European Driving Cycle) range standard mentioned in the first transcript is generally considered more optimistic than EPA standards used in the US. Sodium-ion batteries from CATL are reported to achieve 160 Wh/kg in first generation with goals of exceeding 200 Wh/kg in second generation.
