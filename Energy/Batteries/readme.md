# Battery Chemistry Comparison

| Acronym | Full Name | Energy Density (Wh/kg) | Typical Usage |
|---------|-----------|------------------------|---------------|
| LFP | Lithium Iron Phosphate | 90-160 | Mass market EVs, energy storage systems (BESS), public transport fleets; valued for lower cost and enhanced safety |
| NMC | Nickel Manganese Cobalt | 250-320 | Premium EVs requiring higher range and performance; highest energy density option |
| NCA | Nickel Cobalt Aluminum | 230-260 | High-performance EVs; offers good energy density balance |
| LCO | Lithium Cobalt Oxide | Not specified (older chemistry) | Early lithium-ion batteries; used high amounts of cobalt (0.95kg per kWh) |
| LMO | Lithium Manganese Oxide | Not specified | Early EVs like Chevrolet Volt, Nissan Leaf |
| LMFP | Lithium Manganese Iron Phosphate | Higher than standard LFP | Newer EVs requiring better energy density than standard LFP |

**Note:** Energy density values are based on the transcript information. The actual values may vary based on specific battery designs and manufacturing processes. The NEDC (New European Driving Cycle) range standard mentioned in the transcript is generally considered more optimistic than EPA standards used in the US.
