Estimating the cost of enacting the executive order and the resulting change to U.S. GDP involves significant uncertainty due to the broad scope of the policies, the lack of specific program details, and the variability of economic and market factors. However, we can outline potential cost components and their likely economic impact.

### **Cost Estimate for Enacting the Executive Order**
The executive order's implementation involves several cost-driving elements:

1. **Energy Infrastructure Development:**
   - Costs for expanding production, transportation, refining, and grid modernization.
   - Estimated cost: $500 billion to $1 trillion over a decade (based on historical infrastructure spending benchmarks, such as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law).

2. **Critical Mineral Development:**
   - Investment in domestic mining, processing facilities, and recycling programs.
   - Estimated cost: $50 billion to $100 billion over a decade.

3. **Regulatory and Permitting Streamlining:**
   - Administrative costs for expedited permitting processes and compliance measures.
   - Estimated cost: $10 billion to $20 billion over 5 years.

4. **Defense and Strategic Energy Resilience:**
   - Costs for assessing vulnerabilities, ensuring secure energy supplies for defense, and implementing military construction projects.
   - Estimated cost: $30 billion to $50 billion.

5. **Environmental Mitigation:**
   - Addressing potential environmental impacts from expedited energy development and infrastructure projects.
   - Estimated cost: $20 billion to $40 billion.

**Total Estimated Cost:** $600 billion to $1.2 trillion over 10 years.

### **Estimated Impact on U.S. GDP**
The policies in the executive order aim to enhance energy production, reduce energy costs, and strengthen economic security. Potential GDP effects include:

1. **Increased Energy Production and Exports:**
   - Expanded domestic energy production could increase energy exports, particularly liquefied natural gas (LNG) and critical minerals, contributing $200 billion to $400 billion annually to GDP.

2. **Job Creation and Economic Activity:**
   - Infrastructure investments could create 1 to 2 million jobs, boosting GDP by $100 billion to $200 billion annually.

3. **Reduced Energy Costs:**
   - Improved energy infrastructure and supply could lower energy costs for businesses and households, increasing disposable income and economic productivity.
   - Estimated GDP growth: $50 billion to $150 billion annually.

4. **Technological Innovation:**
   - Investments in renewable energy, energy storage, and critical mineral processing could spur innovation, enhancing GDP growth by $100 billion to $200 billion annually.

**Total Estimated GDP Impact:** $450 billion to $950 billion annually in direct and indirect economic contributions.

### **Net Economic Impact:**
- **Cost-to-GDP Ratio:** The high upfront costs of implementing the executive order (approx. $1.2 trillion over 10 years) are offset by significant GDP growth (up to $950 billion annually), leading to potential net economic benefits within a few years of implementation.
- **ROI Timeline:** The return on investment could begin within 3-5 years as infrastructure projects accelerate and energy exports increase.

---

### Caveats:
- **Market Volatility:** Fluctuations in global energy prices, technological advancements, and geopolitical factors could affect outcomes.
- **Environmental Opposition:** Delays from legal challenges or public resistance to large-scale energy projects could increase costs.
- **Long-Term Benefits:** Investments in renewable energy and critical minerals could position the U.S. as a leader in clean energy, providing sustained economic benefits beyond initial estimates.

These estimates represent a high-level projection based on analogous programs and macroeconomic trends. Detailed financial models and sector-specific data would be necessary for more precise calculations.
