[Monte Carlo method - wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method)

Monte Carlo methods, or Monte Carlo experiments, are a broad class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results.
The underlying concept is to use randomness to solve problems that might be deterministic in principle. The name comes from the Monte Carlo Casino in Monaco,
where the primary developer of the method, physicist Stanislaw Ulam, was inspired by his uncle's gambling habits.

Monte Carlo methods are mainly used in three distinct problem classes: optimization, numerical integration, and generating draws from a probability distribution.
They can also be used to model phenomena with significant uncertainty in inputs, such as calculating the risk of a nuclear power plant failure. Monte Carlo methods
are often implemented using computer simulations, and they can provide approximate solutions to problems that are otherwise intractable or too complex to analyze mathematically.

Monte Carlo Method - Anthropic's AI Claude 

At its core, the Monte Carlo method is a statistical technique that uses random sampling to obtain numerical results. It's named after the famous casino in Monaco, which is fitting given its reliance on randomness and probability.
Key aspects of the Monte Carlo method:

* Random sampling: It generates a large number of random samples.
* Simulation: It uses these samples to simulate a process or solve a problem.
* Statistical analysis: It analyzes the results to draw conclusions or make estimations.

Cholesky decomposition or Cholesky factorization (pronounced /ʃəˈlɛski/ shə-LES-kee) is a decomposition of a Hermitian, positive-definite matrix into the product of a lower triangular matrix and its conjugate transpose, which is useful for efficient numerical solutions, e.g., Monte Carlo simulations. - Wiki
