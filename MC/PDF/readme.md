A probability density function is a function that describes the relative likelihood for a continuous random variable to take on a given value. The integral of a PDF over an interval gives the probability that the variable falls within that interval. Key properties of PDFs include:
* They are always non-negative.
* The total area under the curve must equal 1.
* They are used for continuous random variables, as opposed to probability mass functions for discrete variables.
