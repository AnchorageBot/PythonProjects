Differential equations provide methods for studying dynamic systems.

Specifically, a differential equation is an equation involving a function (which generally represents physical quantities) and its derivatives (which generally represent the rates of change of physical quantities). They may be classified as an ordinary differential equation (ODE) or a partial differential equation (PDE).

The [Laplace Transform](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/LaplaceTransform.html) may be thought of as a 'swiss army knife' for solving many (but not all) ODEs.
