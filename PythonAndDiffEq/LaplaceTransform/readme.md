The Laplace Transform converts time-domain functions into frequency-domain functions, simplifying differential equations into algebraic equations.

$$F(s) = \int_{0}^{\infty} f(t)e^{-st}dt$$


| Symbol/Term | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| F(s) | Output function in frequency/complex domain (transform result) |
| f(t) | Input function in time domain |
| s | Complex frequency parameter (s = σ + jω) |
| t | Time variable |
| e | Euler's number (≈ 2.71828) |
| ∫[0 to ∞] | Definite integral from 0 to infinity |
| e^(-st) | Exponential kernel/transformation factor |

Equation formating:

* GitHub markdown: Uses single $ for inline and double $$ for display math, but not all GitHub views render it
* Google Colab: Fully supports LaTeX in markdown cells with $ and $$
* Jupyter notebooks: Same as Colab
* GitHub README files: Often people include an SVG or PNG of the equation since LaTeX isn't consistently rendered
