The Laplace Transform converts time-domain functions into frequency-domain functions, simplifying differential equations into algebraic equations.

$$F(s) = \int_{0}^{\infty} f(t)e^{-st}dt$$

Equation formating:

* GitHub markdown: Uses single $ for inline and double $$ for display math, but not all GitHub views render it
* Google Colab: Fully supports LaTeX in markdown cells with $ and $$
* Jupyter notebooks: Same as Colab
* GitHub README files: Often people include an SVG or PNG of the equation since LaTeX isn't consistently rendered
