[Leibniz's notation - wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz%27s_notation#:~:text=In%20calculus%2C%20Leibniz's%20notation%2C%20named,of%20x%20and%20y%2C%20respectively.)

In calculus, Leibniz's notation, named in honor of the 17th-century German philosopher and mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, uses the symbols dx and dy to represent infinitely small (or infinitesimal) increments of x and y, respectively, just as Δx and Δy represent finite increments of x and y, respectively
