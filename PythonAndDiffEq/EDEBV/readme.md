Lagrange notation meets Leibniz notation

 f'(x) = $\frac{dy}{dx}$

 $f^n(x)$ = $\frac{d^ny}{dx^n}$

[Joseph-Louis Lagrange -wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph-Louis_Lagrange) (born Giuseppe Luigi Lagrangia or Giuseppe Ludovico De la Grange Tournier; 25 January 1736 – 10 April 1813), also reported as Giuseppe Luigi Lagrange or Lagrangia was an Italian mathematician, physicist and astronomer, later naturalized French. He made significant contributions to the fields of analysis, number theory, and both classical and celestial mechanics.

[Lagrange notation -wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notation_for_differentiation#Lagrange's_notation)

One of the most common modern notations for differentiation is named after Joseph Louis Lagrange, even though it was actually invented by Euler and just popularized by the former. In Lagrange's notation, a prime mark denotes a derivative.

[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz - wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz) (1 July 1646 [O.S. 21 June] – 14 November 1716) was a German polymath active as a mathematician, philosopher, scientist and diplomat who invented calculus in addition to many other branches of mathematics, such as binary arithmetic, and statistics

[Leibniz's notation - wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz%27s_notation#:~:text=In%20calculus%2C%20Leibniz's%20notation%2C%20named,of%20x%20and%20y%2C%20respectively.)

In calculus, Leibniz's notation, named in honor of the 17th-century German philosopher and mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, uses the symbols dx and dy to represent infinitely small (or infinitesimal) increments of x and y, respectively, just as Δx and Δy represent finite increments of x and y, respectively
