        "**What IS a Closed Form:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Basic Operations:**\n",
        "   - Finite number of elementary operations (+, -, ร, รท)\n",
        "   - Integer exponents\n",
        "   - Root operations\n",
        "   - Example: $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$ (quadratic formula)\n",
