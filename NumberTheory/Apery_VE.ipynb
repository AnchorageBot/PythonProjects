        "\n",
        "2. **Integer Approximations:**\n",
        "   - The terms of these sequences satisfy the property that a‚Çô is an integer, while b‚Çô is approximately proportional to n¬≥ (growing polynomially).  \n",
        "   - This setup was crucial because it ensured that the sequence provided a very good rational approximation to Œ∂(3).\n",

        "3. **Linear Independence Argument:**\n",
        "   - Using properties of these sequences and advanced techniques in Diophantine approximation, Ap√©ry demonstrated that Œ∂(3) could not satisfy any linear relation with rational coefficients. This implies Œ∂(3) is irrational.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Non-trivial Bounds:**\n",
        "   - The crux of the proof involved deriving sharp bounds on how well Œ∂(3) can be approximated by rational numbers, showing that no such rational approximation exists.\n",
