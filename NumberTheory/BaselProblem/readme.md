Leonhard Euler's 1734 proof of the irrationality of ζ(2) = z(2) is also know as the Basel problem. The Basel problem is named after Basel, Switzerland - the hometown of the Bernoulli family. Jakob Bernoulli was working on this problem in Basel when he made significant attempts to solve it in the late 17th century, though he wasn't able to find the exact sum.

The connection goes deeper though - Euler himself was born and educated in Basel, where he studied under Johann Bernoulli (Jakob's brother). He began working on this problem while still in Basel, though he actually completed the proof after moving to St. Petersburg.

It's a nice historical touch that one of the most famous problems named after this Swiss city was ultimately solved by a native son of Basel, even though the solution came after he had left. The city of Basel was an important mathematical center during this period, largely due to the Bernoulli family's presence there.

The proof that ζ(2) = π²/6 was one of Euler's earliest major mathematical achievements. In 1734, at just 28 years old, he solved a problem that had stumped mathematicians like Pietro Mengoli and Jakob Bernoulli.

The key steps of Euler's proof involved:

1. Recognizing that the infinite sum 1 + 1/4 + 1/9 + 1/16 + ... (which is ζ(2)) was related to the sine function through its infinite product representation

2. Using the Taylor series expansion of sin(x)/x and comparing coefficients

3. Making a remarkable leap in connecting this infinite sum to π², something no one had previously considered

The proof was groundbreaking not just for solving the specific problem, but for introducing several innovative techniques in mathematical analysis. It showed how transcendental functions could be used to evaluate infinite series, and demonstrated the power of infinite products.

However, it's worth noting that while this 1734 proof was brilliant, it wasn't considered fully rigorous by modern standards. Euler later provided more rigorous versions of the proof, and many mathematicians since then have given alternative proofs of the same result.
