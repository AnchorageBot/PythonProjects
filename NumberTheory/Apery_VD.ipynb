        "Roger Apéry's proof of the irrationality of ζ(3) (the Riemann zeta function evaluated at 3) is a landmark result in mathematics, presented in 1978.  \n",

        "- The Riemann zeta function ζ(s) is defined as:\n",
        "  ζ(s) = ∑ₙ₌₁ⁿ → ∞ (1 / nˢ) for s > 1.  \n",
        "- ζ(3) is called Apéry's constant and is approximately equal to 1.20206…\n",

        "### **Key Elements of Apéry's Proof:**\n",
        "1. **Construction of Special Sequences:**\n",
        "   - Apéry introduced two sequences of rational numbers, aₙ and bₙ, defined using recurrence relations. These sequences were specifically constructed so that:\n",
        "     limₙ → ∞ (aₙ / bₙ) = ζ(3).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Integer Approximations:**\n",
        "   - The terms of these sequences satisfy the property that aₙ is an integer, while bₙ is approximately proportional to n³ (growing polynomially).  \n",
        "   - This setup was crucial because it ensured that the sequence provided a very good rational approximation to ζ(3).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Linear Independence Argument:**\n",
        "   - Using properties of these sequences and advanced techniques in Diophantine approximation, Apéry demonstrated that ζ(3) could not satisfy any linear relation with rational coefficients. This implies ζ(3) is irrational.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Non-trivial Bounds:**\n",
        "   - The crux of the proof involved deriving sharp bounds on how well ζ(3) can be approximated by rational numbers, showing that no such rational approximation exists.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Significance:**\n",
        "- Apéry's proof was surprising and elegant, combining methods from analysis, number theory, and linear algebra.  \n",
        "- The proof inspired further research into the irrationality and transcendence of values of the Riemann zeta function at other points.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Open Questions:**\n",
        "- While ζ(2) = π² / 6 is known to be irrational (and transcendental), the irrationality of ζ(s) for odd integers s > 3 remains an open problem.\n",
