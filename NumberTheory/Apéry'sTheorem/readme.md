Roger Apéry's proof of the irrationality of ζ(3) (the Riemann zeta function evaluated at 3) is a landmark result in mathematics, presented in 1978. 
* Apéry's proof was surprising and elegant, combining methods from analysis, number theory, and linear algebra.
* The proof inspired further research into the irrationality and transcendence of values of the Riemann zeta function at other points.
