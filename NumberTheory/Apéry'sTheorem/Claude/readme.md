Here's a high-level summary of Apéry's groundbreaking 1979 paper on the irrationality of ζ(2) and ζ(3):

Key Achievement:
- Proved that ζ(3) is irrational, which was a major breakthrough in number theory
- Provided a new method for proving ζ(2)'s irrationality (though this was already known from Euler)
- Developed a general framework for proving irrationality of certain infinite series

Core Methodological Framework:
1. Acceleration of Convergence
   - Started with a slowly converging series representation
   - Transformed it into faster converging sequences using double indexing
   - Used clever combinatorial structures (binomial coefficients) to control growth

2. Diophantine Approximation Strategy
   - Constructed two sequences (un and vn) with special properties
   - Used recurrence relations to generate these sequences efficiently
   - For ζ(3): Found sequences satisfying a third-order recurrence equation
   - For ζ(2): Used a second-order recurrence equation

3. Growth Rate Analysis
   - Introduced parameter μ (e² for ζ(2), e³ for ζ(3))
   - Found parameter λ that controls the growth of approximations
   - Showed λ > μ to prove irrationality
   - Used this to derive explicit irrationality measures

Key Technical Elements:
- For ζ(3): Used the series expansion 1/n³ = 1/(n(n²-1)) - 1/(n(n²-1)(n²-4)) + ...
- Found the crucial representation: ζ(3) = 5/2 Σ (-1)^(n-1)/(n³(2n choose n))
- Developed modular arithmetic techniques to handle denominators
- Used linear combinations with integer coefficients to maintain control over denominators

Historical Context:
- Approached infinite series carefully, acknowledging historical skepticism
- Built on but significantly extended classical methods
- Opened new directions in the study of values of the Riemann zeta function

The brilliance of Apéry's work lies in combining elementary tools (recurrence relations, combinatorial identities) to solve a deep problem that had resisted more sophisticated approaches. While the original proof was considered somewhat mysterious, subsequent work has clarified and extended his methods, leading to a better understanding of the nature of important mathematical constants.
