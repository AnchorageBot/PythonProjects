Roger Apéry's proof of the irrationality of ζ(3) (the Riemann zeta function evaluated at 3) is a landmark result in mathematics, presented in 1978. 

Key Elements of his proof:

* Construction of Special Sequences:
  * Apéry introduced two sequences of rational numbers, (a_n) and (b_n), defined using recurrence relations.
  * These sequences were specifically constructed so that: [ \lim_{n → ∞} \frac{a_n}{b_n} = ζ(3). ]

* Integer Approximations:
  * The terms of these sequences satisfy the property that (a_n) is an integer, while (b_n) is approximately proportional to (n³) (growing polynomially).
  * This setup was crucial because it ensured that the sequence provided a very good rational approximation to ζ(3).

* Linear Independence Argument:
  * Using properties of these sequences and advanced techniques in Diophantine approximation, Apéry demonstrated that ζ(3) could not satisfy any linear relation with rational coefficients. This implies ζ(3) is irrational.

* Non-trivial Bounds:
  * The crux of the proof involved deriving sharp bounds on how well ζ(3) can be approximated by rational numbers, showing that no such rational approximation exists.

|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ζ(3)                              | Riemann zeta function evaluated at 3: `ζ(3) = ∑ₙ₌₁ⁿ → ∞ (1 / n³)`, known as Apéry's constant.          |
| `aₙ`                              | Sequence of integers constructed using combinatorial sums: `aₙ = ∑ₖ₌₀ⁿ (C(n, k)² × C(n+k, k)²)`.       |
| `bₙ`                              | Denominator sequence: `bₙ = (n+1)³`, a cubic polynomial in `n`.                                         |
| `rₙ`                              | Error term in approximations of ζ(3): `rₙ = bₙ × ζ(3) − aₙ`.                                           |
| `C(n, k)`                         | Binomial coefficient: `C(n, k) = n! / (k! × (n−k)!)`, representing the number of ways to choose `k` items from `n`. |
| `|rₙ| < 1 / bₙ²`                  | Bound on the error term: The error `rₙ` decreases as `1/bₙ²`, ensuring sharper convergence than generic irrational approximations. |
| `uₙ`                              | General term in the recurrence relation: `uₙ = aₙ` or `bₙ`.                                            |
| Recurrence relation               | Governs `aₙ` and `bₙ`: `(n+1)³uₙ₊₁ − (34n³ + 51n² + 27n + 5)uₙ + n³uₙ₋₁ = 0`.                         |
| Linear independence               | Property that ζ(3) and 1 cannot satisfy a relation `c₁ × ζ(3) + c₂ = 0` with `c₁, c₂ ∈ ℚ`.              |
| Dirichlet’s approximation theorem | States that for any irrational `x`, there exist infinitely many `p/q` such that `|x − p/q| < 1/q²`.     |
| Rational number                   | A number expressed as `p/q`, where `p, q ∈ ℤ`, and `q ≠ 0`.                                             |
| Polynomial growth                 | Behavior of `bₙ = (n+1)³`, ensuring controlled and predictable convergence of `aₙ / bₙ` to ζ(3).         |
| `∑`                               | Summation operator: Represents the sum of terms, such as `∑ₙ₌₁ⁿ → ∞ (1 / n³)` for ζ(3).                |
| `|x − p/q| > C/q²`                | A lower bound for rational approximations of irrational numbers: Rational approximations cannot have errors smaller than `C/q²`, where `C > 0`. |
| Irrationality                     | Property that ζ(3) cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers (not rational).                       |
| `≪`                               | Much less than: Indicates rapid decay, e.g., `|rₙ| ≪ 1/n⁶` means the error term `rₙ` decreases much faster than `1/n⁶`. |
| Non-trivial bounds                | Sharp bounds on approximation errors (`|rₙ| < 1/bₙ²`) that exceed classical limits, used to prove irrationality. |
