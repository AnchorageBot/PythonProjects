Apéry's Proof

In 1978, Roger Apéry surprisingly proved that ζ(3) is indeed irrational. His proof was quite complex and didn't initially gain widespread acceptance due to its unconventional nature. However, it was eventually recognized as correct and ingenious.

Here's a simplified summary of the key ideas behind Apéry's proof:

* Constructing two sequences: Apéry constructed two sequences of integers, (aₙ) and (bₙ), with the following properties:
  * The ratio aₙ/bₙ provides increasingly accurate approximations of ζ(3).
  * The sequences satisfy a specific recurrence relation.

* Recurrence relation: The recurrence relation satisfied by the sequences is crucial. It links successive terms in each sequence in a particular way. This relation is what ultimately allows for the proof of irrationality.

* Diophantine approximation: Apéry showed that the approximations aₙ/bₙ are "too good" to be consistent with ζ(3) being a rational number. In other words, if ζ(3) were rational, these approximations would converge too rapidly, contradicting known results in Diophantine approximation (the study of approximating real numbers by rational numbers).

* Contradiction: By demonstrating this contradiction, Apéry concluded that ζ(3) must be irrational.
